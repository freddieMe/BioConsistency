Subsequently, we analyzed DNA methylation in the entire tandem repeats and in the regions upstream and downstream of the SDC repeats by bisulfite sequencing. In WT plants, all of the sequence contexts were densely methylated (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7). Consistent with this, DNA methylation at CHG and CHH sites in the SDC tandem repeats was slightly reduced in the ibm1 alleles, whereas that in the regions flanking the repeats was not obviously changed (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7).

0.63	22772985_20|22772985|4761|INTRODUCTION|0:0|It has also been reported that the SRA domain in SUV4 preferentially binds double-stranded oligonucleotides containing methylated cytosines in a non-CG context, which suggests that this histone modifier can read DNA methylation marks directly (24).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.61	22772985_6|22772985|1302|INTRODUCTION|0:0|In Arabidopsis, the maintenance of DNA methylation is primarily dependent on three methyltransferases: METHLYTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a DNMT1 homolog that is responsible for maintaining CG methylation after DNA replication (4,5); DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2), a DNMT3 homolog that catalyzes de novo DNA methylation (6,7); and CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3), a plant-specific DNA methyltransferase that functions in non-CG methylation maintenance redundantly with DRM2 (6,7).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

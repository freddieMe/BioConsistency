Unlike after incubation with 1 mg/ml of control gamma-immunoglobulins or buffer alone, both antibody concentrations dramatically reduced the activity of CYPOR, as assessed by the ability of brain membranes to reduce cytochrome c (Figure 2B). Similarly, NADPH-dependent NO consumption was reduced by incubation with 0.33 mg/ml alpha-CYPOR, but not by gamma-immunoglobulins or buffer (Figure 2C), indicating that NO consumption by brain membranes is dependent on CYPOR activity.

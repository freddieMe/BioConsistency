21335549_1|21335549|19515|#section_info|0:435|Finally to determine whether asparaginyl hydroxylation might persist under conditions that induce HIF proteins in intact tissues, we studied HIF-1alpha from kidneys of rats that had been exposed to 0.1% carbon monoxide to create functional anemia and from a range of human tumor samples (Fig. 3E). These studies demonstrate the existence of substantial levels of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation under these pathophysiological conditions.|#main_body|GO:0001666|response to hypoxia|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Hif1a(29560)|#gene_synonym

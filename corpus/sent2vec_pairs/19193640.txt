0.67	19193640_75|19193640|20215|RESULTS|0:0|In these cells,  Src-pY416 is normally enriched at dynamic ruffles and at the cell cortex,  whereas in cells depleted of annexin 2, Src-pY416 was mislocalized to the ends  of F-actin stress fibers (supplemental Fig. 2).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.66	19193640_133|19193640|36308|DISCUSSION|0:0|Our data suggest a role  for annexin 2 not only in the trafficking of Src to the plasma membrane that  is essential for its activation but also in the stimulation of actin dynamics  and the remodeling of focal adhesions that are required for transformation.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.65	19193640_77|19193640|20929|RESULTS|0:0|To confirm that the resistance of annexin 2-depleted cells to  transformation by Src was a direct result of the loss of annexin 2 and not due  to some other epiphenomenon, we performed a "reversal of  phenotype" experiment in which an siRNA-resistant "hardened"  annexin 2-GFP fusion protein (hdanx2-GFP) was expressed in knockdown R1LA29  cells (12).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.64	19193640_74|19193640|20215|RESULTS|0:0|We also investigated annexin 2 involvement in the activation of endogenous  c-Src by performing siRNA experiments to deplete annexin 2 in MIO cells, an  untransformed, spontaneously motile glial cell line described in previous  studies (12).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.63	19193640_99|19193640|28908|DISCUSSION|0:0|This is consistent with our previous studies in human  Muller cells in which we showed that annexin 2 is involved in the  remodeling of actin filaments by barbed end capping  (12) and with recent reports  that tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 2 is sufficient to induce the changes  in actin dynamics that accompany transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal  transition (33,  34).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.63	19193640_125|19193640|34032|DISCUSSION|0:0|When the failure  of v-Src to accumulate on the perinuclear Rab11-positive endosomal recycling  compartment in annexin 2-depleted cells is also taken into account, these  results suggest that without annexin 2, there is neither endosomal traffic of  v-Src to nor macropinocytic/endocytic cycling from the  plasma membrane.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19193640_17|19193640|3867|abstract|0:0|Recent publications have demonstrated the importance of the phosphorylation  of annexin 2 in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by v-Src  overexpression or treatment with hepatocyte growth factor  (33) and in the  insulin-mediated transformation of baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-IR cells)  (34).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19193640_19|19193640|3867|abstract|0:0|In this study, we used small  interfering RNA (siRNA) to deplete fibroblasts of annexin 2 and then examined  the effects of activation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src on cell  morphology, F-actin, the localization of activated Src, and the  phosphorylation of FAK.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19193640_21|19193640|3867|abstract|0:0|We demonstrate that cells  lacking annexin 2 fail to undergo the phenotypic changes and  anchorage-independent growth that characterize transformation and show that  phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 576 is defective.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19193640_102|19193640|29852|DISCUSSION|0:0|When cells were depleted of annexin 2 in  this system, the cysts failed to form a proper lumen, underlining the  importance of annexin 2 in maintaining cellular junctions and polarity, a  process known to be dependent upon c-Src  (38-40).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19193640_122|19193640|34032|DISCUSSION|0:0|The colocalization we observed between annexin 2 and active Src, FAK-Y576,  and paxillin-Y118 on internal membranes during transformation is consistent  with the idea that trafficking and targeting of v-Src to the plasma membrane  are coupled to the retrieval and recycling of v-Src and other focal adhesion  components via macropinosomes or endosomes.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.61	19193640_129|19193640|35636|DISCUSSION|0:0|Given that annexin 2 is essential for the formation of actin tails that  propel endosomes and macropinosomes from the plasma membrane to the interior  of the cell (16,  18,  46), we propose that annexin 2  forms part of the actin regulatory machinery that regulates the endosomal  trafficking and activation of Src.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

22105348_24|22105348|15143|#section_info|0:0|To investigate the cause of MyoV loss observed in crb mutant photoreceptors, we aimed to prevent the loss of MyoV by overexpression of a dominant-negative proteasome subunit Pros2612B (Belote and Fortier, 2002). This resulted in a marked increase in MyoV staining (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 2 D). Quantification of MyoV fluorescence (normalized to WT MyoV fluorescence per ommatidium, as described in Materials and methods) showed that the reduction of MyoV seen in crb mutant photoreceptors is rescued to ~80% of that seen in WT ommatidia upon proteasome inhibition in comparison with ~50% in the absence of proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 2 E). These data suggest that crb stabilizes MyoV protein by protecting it from degradation by the proteasome.|#main_body|GO:0032435|negative regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym

22105348_39|22105348|24510|#section_info|0:0|Although the results from the S2R+ experiments allowed us to narrow down the portion of Crb required for interaction with MyoV, they also showed that in this system, Crb could ectopically recruit MyoV to the plasma membrane. Despite the extremely simplified nature of the S2R+ system in comparison with PRCs and the fact that in crb mutant photoreceptors, the residual MyoV localization is predominantly WT, we tested whether or not Crb is capable of performing the same function in PRCs. Using Rh1-Gal4, we expressed either full-length Crb (CrbFull length) or a construct of Crb in which the extracellular domain of Crb has been replaced by a Flag tag (CrbFlag intra). Although both of these transgene-encoded proteins localize ectopically to the rhabdomere base and basolateral membranes, as previously described (Richard et al., 2009), neither is able to recruit MyoV to these sites (Fig. 5, E and F). Therefore, we conclude that the S2R+ experiments can be used only as a basic method to analyze the domains for the Crb-MyoV interaction and that the physiologically relevant role of this interaction in the adult photoreceptor is not one of recruitment/localization but rather of stabilization.|#main_body|GO:0050821|protein stabilization|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym

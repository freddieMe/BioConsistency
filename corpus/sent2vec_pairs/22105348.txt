22105348_19|22105348|10186|#section_info|584:1144|To identify the localization of the remaining MyoV in crb mutant photoreceptors, we generated small clones of crb11A22 in the retina, allowing us to image mutant and WT tissue adjacent to one another. Staining such retinal sections (from 2-4-d-old adult flies) for MyoV confirms what we observe in the Western blot data, as very little signal can be detected in the mutant tissue (Fig. 2 A). The remaining MyoV localizes to the rhabdomere base and sometimes to the stalk membrane (Fig. 2 A, arrowheads), the latter being seldom, if ever, observed in WT tissue.|#main_body|GO:0016028|rhabdomere|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|MyoV(35680)|#gene_synonym

22105348_39|22105348|24510|#section_info|0:1198|Although the results from the S2R+ experiments allowed us to narrow down the portion of Crb required for interaction with MyoV, they also showed that in this system, Crb could ectopically recruit MyoV to the plasma membrane. Despite the extremely simplified nature of the S2R+ system in comparison with PRCs and the fact that in crb mutant photoreceptors, the residual MyoV localization is predominantly WT, we tested whether or not Crb is capable of performing the same function in PRCs. Using Rh1-Gal4, we expressed either full-length Crb (CrbFull length) or a construct of Crb in which the extracellular domain of Crb has been replaced by a Flag tag (CrbFlag intra). Although both of these transgene-encoded proteins localize ectopically to the rhabdomere base and basolateral membranes, as previously described (Richard et al., 2009), neither is able to recruit MyoV to these sites (Fig. 5, E and F). Therefore, we conclude that the S2R+ experiments can be used only as a basic method to analyze the domains for the Crb-MyoV interaction and that the physiologically relevant role of this interaction in the adult photoreceptor is not one of recruitment/localization but rather of stabilization.|#main_body|GO:0050821|protein stabilization|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym

Levels of p-moesin remained elevated in all successive steps of cell division. The locations of p-moesin strictly paralleled, in time and space, sites of cortical contraction during division (Fig. 2 B). From prophase to metaphase, p-moesin was uniformly distributed at the mitotic cortex. In later stages, p-moesin became progressively restricted to the equator and accumulated at the cleavage furrow (Fig. 2 B).|#main_body|GO:1990023|mitotic spindle midzone|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|p-moesin(31816)|#gene_synonym

Moreover, two significantly different populations of seeds were observed in the siliques of siz1-2, among which some seeds were well developed (Figure 2B, D).

22253727_11|22253727|16350|#section_info|0:0|Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pollen tubes could be seen adhering tightly to the funiculus and grow toward the micropyle, precisely entering the micropylar opening of the ovule in the wild-type siliques (Figure 4H). Although pollen tubes were present in most of the siz1-2 ovules, they behaved differently after presenting from the septum. Most of pollen tubes grew along the funiculus and entered the micropyle of some ovules in siz1-2 pistils (Figure 4I). However, the pollen tubes in other ovules failed to find the micropylar opening and grew without definite direction (Figure 4J, K, L); some of them bypassed the micropyle and grew on the ovule surface (Figure 4J) or even turned away (Figure 4K), or ceased to grow near the micropyle (Figure 4L). Furthermore, no pollen tube growth was found on the funiculus in a small proportion of siz1-2 ovules (Figure 4M).|#main_body|GO:0010183|pollen tube guidance|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym

Although pollen tubes were present in most of the siz1-2 ovules, they behaved differently after presenting from the septum. Most of pollen tubes grew along the funiculus and entered the micropyle of some ovules in siz1-2 pistils (Figure 4I). However, the pollen tubes in other ovules failed to find the micropylar opening and grew without definite direction (Figure 4J, K, L); some of them bypassed the micropyle and grew on the ovule surface (Figure 4J) or even turned away (Figure 4K), or ceased to grow near the micropyle (Figure 4L). Furthermore, no pollen tube growth was found on the funiculus in a small proportion of siz1-2 ovules (Figure 4M).|#main_body|GO:0010183|pollen tube guidance|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|AT5G60410(836163)|#gene_synonym

0.68	22253727_136|22253727|25508|Discussion|0:0|In the present study, we found that some mature ovules in siz1 mutants failed to attract pollen tubes, while the absence of SIZ1 did not lead to a change in the mRNA levels of those proteins previously identified to be involved in pollen tube guidance, seemingly ruling out the possibility that SIZ1 might work as a transcription regulator for these genes.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

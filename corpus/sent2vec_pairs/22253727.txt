The pollen tubes in wild-type siliques grew along the funiculus and entered the female gametophyte successfully, after leaving the transmitting tract, 99.2% (n = 267) of ovules received pollen tubes (Figure 4C). In siz1-2 ovaries, 17.9% of ovules (130 of 724) did not have a pollen tube arriving at the micropylar opening. Some pollen tubes appeared to have lost their way soon after they grew out from the transmitting tract because they did not appear on the funiculus of some ovules (11.3%, n = 724) (Figure 4D, Figure S2). Other pollen tubes could grow on the funicular tissue, they even arrived near the micropylar opening of the ovules (6.6%,  6%, n = 724), but turned away and failed to enter the embryo sacs (Figure 4E, F, G, Figure S2).|#main_body|GO:0010183|pollen tube guidance|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym

Most of pollen tubes grew along the funiculus and entered the micropyle of some ovules in siz1-2 pistils (Figure 4I). However, the pollen tubes in other ovules failed to find the micropylar opening and grew without definite direction (Figure 4J, K, L); some of them bypassed the micropyle and grew on the ovule surface (Figure 4J) or even turned away (Figure 4K), or ceased to grow near the micropyle (Figure 4L).

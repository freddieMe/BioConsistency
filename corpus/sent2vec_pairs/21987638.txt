21987638_47|21987638|18167|#section_info|0:0|We tested for a genetic interaction between PP2ATws and Plk4 by depleting PP2ATws in S2 cells expressing a Plk4 construct harboring a Slimb-binding mutation (SBM; a nonphosphorylatable alanine [S293A/T297A] mutation), which prevents Slimb binding (Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2009). Like Slimb RNAi, Plk4-SBM expression increased the percentage of cells containing greater than two centrioles (Fig. 3 C; Rogers et al., 2009). We hypothesized that if PP2ATws dephosphorylates and stabilizes Plk4, expression of Plk4-SBM would rescue the loss of centrioles after Tws depletion (Fig. 3 C). We found this to be the case, as Plk4-SBM expression restored centriole numbers to control levels (Fig. 3 C). Together, these results suggest that PP2ATws promotes centriole duplication by stabilizing Plk4 and, furthermore, may work by dephosphorylating key residues in the Plk4 SBD to block Slimb binding.|#main_body|GO:0050821|protein stabilization|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|Tws(47877)|#gene_synonym

21987638_48|21987638|18167|#section_info|0:0|We tested for a genetic interaction between PP2ATws and Plk4 by depleting PP2ATws in S2 cells expressing a Plk4 construct harboring a Slimb-binding mutation (SBM; a nonphosphorylatable alanine [S293A/T297A] mutation), which prevents Slimb binding (Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2009). Like Slimb RNAi, Plk4-SBM expression increased the percentage of cells containing greater than two centrioles (Fig. 3 C; Rogers et al., 2009). We hypothesized that if PP2ATws dephosphorylates and stabilizes Plk4, expression of Plk4-SBM would rescue the loss of centrioles after Tws depletion (Fig. 3 C). We found this to be the case, as Plk4-SBM expression restored centriole numbers to control levels (Fig. 3 C). Together, these results suggest that PP2ATws promotes centriole duplication by stabilizing Plk4 and, furthermore, may work by dephosphorylating key residues in the Plk4 SBD to block Slimb binding.|#main_body|GO:0007099|centriole replication|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|Tws(47877)|#gene_synonym

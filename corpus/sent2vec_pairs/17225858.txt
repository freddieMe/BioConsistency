However, when large pollen loads are deposited onto the stigmas, the transposon mutation is vastly underrepresented in the progeny, indicating that this major pollen allergen has a large effect on pollen tube growth rates in vivo, and plays an important role in determining the outcome of the pollen-pollen competition for access to the ovules.|#main_body|GO:0009860|pollen tube growth|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|EXP1(541904)|#gene_synonym

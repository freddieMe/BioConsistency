0.7	22702356_6|22702356|523|abstract|0:0|Here, we studied the UV-B regulation of P1 in maize leaves of high altitude landraces, and we investigated how UV-B regulates P1binding to the CHS promoter in both low and high altitude lines.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.7	22702356_28|22702356|3637|Background|0:0|Previously, we established that some maize landraces, specifically those adapted to high altitudes, accumulate flavones and express P1 in leaves and other green tissues in the presence of UV-B, in sharp departure to the floral-organ specific expression domain of P1 found in most other maize inbred lines [17].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.7	22702356_190|22702356|31963|Discussion|0:0|Using young leaves of five different maize high-altitude landraces, we found that P1 is induced by UV-B, both at the transcript and at the protein levels, in contrast to B73 or W23, which showed almost undetectable expression levels, and very low induction by UV-B.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.69	22702356_79|22702356|15391|Results|0:0|Because we found that high altitude landraces show P1 induction by UV-B, and higher expression in leaves compared to the low altitude lines B73 and W23, we then cloned and compared P1 promoter sequences from the different landraces to analyze the presence of putative regulatory sequences that may be responsible for the differential patterns of expression.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.69	22702356_189|22702356|31963|Discussion|0:0|Here, we focused on the analysis of P1 expression in leaves and its regulation by UV-B radiation in high altitude maize landraces, and its comparison with low altitude inbred lines, like B73 and W23.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.68	22702356_7|22702356|523|abstract|0:0|In addition, we analyzed whether the expansion in the P1 expression domain between these maize landraces and inbred lines is associated to changes in the molecular structure of the proximal promoter, distal enhancer and first intron of P1.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.67	22702356_8|22702356|523|abstract|0:0|Finally, using transient expression experiments in protoplasts from various maize genotypes, we investigated whether the different expression patterns of P1 in the high altitude landraces could be attributed to trans- or cis-acting elements.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.67	22702356_34|22702356|4833|Background|0:0|Therefore, these indigenous landraces are predicted to have improved UV-B tolerance, reflecting recurrent selection against visible symptoms of UV-B stress.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.67	22702356_37|22702356|5548|Background|0:0|We then analyzed the molecular structure of the P1 promoter alleles in these landraces, and investigated which regulatory motifs may be responsible of the regulation of P1 by UV-B.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.67	22702356_38|22702356|5548|Background|0:0|Finally, to study if the different expression patterns of P1 in the high altitude landraces can be attributed to the presence of trans- or cis-acting elements in the landraces, transient expression analysis using leaf protoplasts from W23 and Mishca, and proximal promoter constructs fused to the luciferase gene reporter were analyzed.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.66	22702356_191|22702356|31963|Discussion|0:0|In addition, P1 is able to increase the transcription of the CHS gene after a UV-B treatment in Confite, while up-regulation of this gene by UV-B is not observed in W23 (Figure  2).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.66	22702356_197|22702356|31963|Discussion|0:0|Thus, it is clear that P1 participates in the UV-B induction of the flavonoid pathway in leaves of high altitude landraces, but not in leaves of low altitude lines.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

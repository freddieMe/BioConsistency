Fatty acid composition analyses revealed that the levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1) increased significantly in fad2, whereas the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids  whereas the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2 and 18:3) decreased significantly, when compared with those in the wild-type plants. |#main_body|GO:0006636|unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|FAD2(820387)|#gene_synonym

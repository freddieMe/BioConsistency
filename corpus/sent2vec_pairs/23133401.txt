We also noticed that as1 fil YAB3/yab3 and as1 jag siliques were very similar, although in as1 fil YAB3/yab3 the replum had fewer cells and was less twisted (Figure S7D, S7E, S7H, S7I). Similar to mutant fruits affected in JAG/FIL activity genes, repla of as1 fil YAB3/yab3 fruits were abnormally wider, showing more and larger epidermal cells, and also presented frequent interspersed stomata, being quite difficult to distinguish them from valves (Figure S7E, S7I).|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|AS1(818340)|#gene_synonym

In the basal region of as1 fil yab3 ovaries, the most prevalent phenotype was the presence of two thin stripes of valve margin located at the lateral-most regions of the ovary, both separating what we called two giant "super-repla" (Figure 6H, 6L). We also found fruits with extremely small valves separated from the oversized repla by valve margin tissue (Figure S10B). The aberrant replum of as1 fil yab3 fruits contained wide and large cells and fully developed stomata, making this tissue to adopt a similar appearance to wild-type valves (Figure S7F). In fact, the phenotype was even stronger in the apical region of the ovary where only these wide and large cells and stomata could be observed, completely lacking valve margin tissue (Figure 6H, 6K).|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|AS1(818340)|#gene_synonym

23133401_41|23133401|35119|#section_info|272:779|The fruit phenotypes described for combinations of as1 and mutant alleles in JAG/FIL activity genes are very much in line with these predictions (Figure 7G and Figure S6). In strong agreement, as1 fil yab3 and 35S::BP fil yab3 plants produced fruits with huge repla that contained abnormal cell types, and an extreme reduction or abolishment of valve development (Figure 6H, 6I, 6K, 6L and Figure S10B). This phenotype is mainly due to ectopic expression of BP in a background with reduced JAG/FIL activity.|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|AS1(818340)|#gene_synonym

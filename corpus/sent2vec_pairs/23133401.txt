The exception was the yab3 single mutant, in which the behavior of the BP::GUS reporter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (data not shown).

When the JAG/FIL activity was compromised, we observed that the intensity of the BP::GUS signal increased and its expression domain expanded, achieving the widest domain in the fil yab3 jag triple mutant (Figure 3B-3F). The exception was the yab3 single mutant, in which the behavior of the BP::GUS reporter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (data not shown). Nevertheless, we observed by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) a significant increase in the expression levels of BP transcripts in the pistils of all backgrounds affected in JAG/FIL activity, including yab3 (Figure 3G). Therefore, these results and those shown in the previous section indicate that the JAG/FIL activity, functioning in valves and valve margins, negatively regulates BP expression in medial domains and that this repression is required for the correct specification of the replum.|#main_body|GO:0010629|negative regulation of gene expression|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|JAG(843177)|#gene_synonym

When the JAG/FIL activity was compromised, we observed that the intensity of the BP::GUS signal increased and its expression domain expanded, achieving the widest domain in the fil yab3 jag triple mutant (Figure 3B-3F). The exception was the yab3 single mutant, in which the behavior of the BP::GUS reporter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (data not shown). Nevertheless, we observed by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) a significant increase in the expression levels of BP transcripts in the pistils of all backgrounds affected in JAG/FIL activity, including yab3 (Figure 3G). Therefore, these results and those shown in the previous section indicate that the JAG/FIL activity, functioning in valves and valve margins, negatively regulates BP expression in medial domains and that this repression is required for the correct specification of the replum.|#main_body|GO:0010629|negative regulation of gene expression|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|YAB3(827914)|#gene_synonym

In the basal region of as1 fil yab3 ovaries, the most prevalent phenotype was the presence of two thin stripes of valve margin located at the lateral-most regions of the ovary, both separating what we called two giant "super-repla" (Figure 6H, 6L). We also found fruits with extremely small valves separated from the oversized repla by valve margin tissue (Figure S10B). The aberrant replum of as1 fil yab3 fruits contained wide and large cells and fully developed stomata, making this tissue to adopt a similar appearance to wild-type valves (Figure S7F). In fact, the phenotype was even stronger in the apical region of the ovary where only these wide and large cells and stomata could be observed, completely lacking valve margin tissue (Figure 6H, 6K).|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|AS1(818340)|#gene_synonym

In the basal region of as1 fil yab3 ovaries, the most prevalent phenotype was the presence of two thin stripes of valve margin located at the lateral-most regions of the ovary, both separating what we called two giant "super-repla" (Figure 6H, 6L). We also found fruits with extremely small valves separated from the oversized repla by valve margin tissue (Figure S10B). The aberrant replum of as1 fil yab3 fruits contained wide and large cells and fully developed stomata, making this tissue to adopt a similar appearance to wild-type valves (Figure S7F). In fact, the phenotype was even stronger in the apical region of the ovary where only these wide and large cells and stomata could be observed, completely lacking valve margin tissue (Figure 6H, 6K).|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|FIL(819127)|#gene_synonym

In the basal region of as1 fil yab3 ovaries, the most prevalent phenotype was the presence of two thin stripes of valve margin located at the lateral-most regions of the ovary, both separating what we called two giant "super-repla" (Figure 6H, 6L). We also found fruits with extremely small valves separated from the oversized repla by valve margin tissue (Figure S10B). The aberrant replum of as1 fil yab3 fruits contained wide and large cells and fully developed stomata, making this tissue to adopt a similar appearance to wild-type valves (Figure S7F). In fact, the phenotype was even stronger in the apical region of the ovary where only these wide and large cells and stomata could be observed, completely lacking valve margin tissue (Figure 6H, 6K).|#main_body|GO:0010154|fruit development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|YAB3(827914)|#gene_synonym

23145086_7|23145086|45555|#section_info|192:876|To provide experimental data supporting this assumption, the subcellular localization of Arabidopsis FPS1S and FPS2 was investigated by transiently expressing N- and C-terminal fusions of both FPS isoforms to the GFP in agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaf cells (Figure 5). Confocal laser microscopy analysis of the transfected cells revealed that all four tested proteins (GFP-FPS1S, FPS1S-GFP, GFP-FPS2, and FPS2-GFP) showed a diffuse pattern of fluorescence throughout the cytosol that was completely different from the punctuate fluorescence pattern characteristic for peroxisomal proteins, as revealed by comparison with the fluorescence signal of the peroxisomal marker CFP-SKL.|#main_body|GO:0005829|cytosol|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|FPS1S(834828)|#gene_synonym

0.7	19845505_137|19845505|25411|RESULTS AND DISCUSSSION|0:0|As more of TMD2 and the following loop are translated, the putative signal sequence in TMD1 emerges from the ribosome, allowing it to bind SRP.|#fig_caption|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.65	19845505_29|19845505|3950|INTRODUCTION|0:0|Co-translational targeting is initiated when SRP binds simultaneously to the exposed signal sequence and the ribosome, forming the SRP-ribosome nascent chain complex [15].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.63	19845505_23|19845505|2940|INTRODUCTION|0:0|Targeting of proteins to the ER is mediated by a short stretch of amino acid residues, the signal sequence, which may be either an N-terminal sequence that is later cleaved, or an internal non-cleavable sequence [12].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19845505_31|19845505|3950|INTRODUCTION|0:0|The SRP-ribosome nascent chain complex then binds to the SRP receptor within the ER membrane [18], SRP dissociates, protein synthesis resumes and the growing protein is directed into the ER through the open translocon.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.62	19845505_37|19845505|5025|INTRODUCTION|0:0|None of the cytosolic motifs known to mediate ER retrieval are present in IP3R, but our earlier work demonstrated that any pair of TMD with a linking luminal loop can retain an IP3R fragment or a plasma membrane protein within the ER [26].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.61	19845505_25|19845505|2940|INTRODUCTION|0:0|Signal sequences vary widely in primary sequence, but in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes they share a hydrophobic core of 8-12 residues for cleavable signals and of 20-30 residues for internal signals [13].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.61	19845505_26|19845505|2940|INTRODUCTION|0:0|The diversity of signal sequences allows them to function with different efficiencies and also provides a mechanism that allows proteins that might become terminally misfolded to be directed away from the ER for degradation during ER stress [14].|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

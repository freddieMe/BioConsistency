The biotinylated membrane fractions were not contaminated by non-plasma membrane proteins because the actin, a cytoskeletal protein, was negligible in the biotinylated fractions but was clearly present in the corresponding whole-cell lysates |#main_body|GO:0005886|plasma membrane|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Trpc6(89823)|#gene_synonym

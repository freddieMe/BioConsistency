22701670_7|22701670|10731|#section_info|0:0|Suppression of Tap42 in the pnr domain resulted in the appearance of a marked thorax cleft (Fig. 1-B2), but the wings appeared normal (Fig. 1-C2). In comparison to pnr-Gal4 activity, ap-Gal4 activity extends from the stalk to the dorsal/ventral boundary and not only includes the notum, but hinge and wing compartments as well (Fig. 1-A2). As expected, given the broader activity of the ap-Gal4 driver in the wing discs, Drosophila lines expressing Tap42RNAi under the control of ap-Gal4 exhibited more complex phenotypes that included varying degrees of a cleft thorax (Fig. 1-B3) as well as significant wing deformities (Fig. 1-C3). Necrosis of the front leg joints was also observed in some of these flies (Fig. S2-B). These findings suggest that Tap42 is involved in wing imaginal disc morphogenesis and plays a crucial role in the patterning and differentiation of wing discs.|#main_body|GO:0007472|wing disc morphogenesis|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym

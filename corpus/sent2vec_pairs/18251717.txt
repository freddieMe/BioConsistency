Proton-leak kinetics were measured after energization with succinate for 2.5 min in the absence and presence of carboxyatractylate and GDP to determine whether ANT and UCP3 were involved (Figure 4A). Figure 4(B) shows that at the highest common membrane potential, 180 mV, GDP and carboxyatractylate significantly inhibited proton conductance separately and in combination. The extent of the carboxyatractylate inhibition of proton conductance suggests that the majority is attributable to ANT.

0.62	18251717_8|18251717|99|abstract|0:0|We conclude the following: (i) at high protonmotive force, an endogenously generated activator stimulates proton conductance catalysed partly by UCP3 and partly by the adenine nucleotide translocase; (ii) GDP is not a specific inhibitor of UCP3, but also inhibits proton translocation by the adenine nucleotide translocase; and (iii) the inhibition of UCP3 by carboxyatractylate and bongkrekate is likely to be indirect, acting through the adenine nucleotide translocase.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

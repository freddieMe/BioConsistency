23055943_9|23055943|16998|#section_info|808:1201|Analysis of reactivated P1-rr'Ufo1-1 plants revealed that DNA methylation was dramatically reduced at all symmetric and asymmetric cytosines to a level comparable with that of the P1-rr ufo1 plants. Therefore, the DNA gel blot and bisulfite sequencing analyses demonstrated that Ufo1-1-mediated reactivation of P1-rr' correlates with reduction of methylation within the P1.2 enhancer fragment.|#main_body|GO:0032776|DNA methylation on cytosine|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Ufo1-1(3760032)|#gene_synonym

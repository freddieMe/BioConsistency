0.63	23028662_23|23028662|4071|Introduction|0:0|To investigate the effects of Rheb overexpression specifically within the D. melanogaster central brain, we used the Gal4-UAS system [23] to target two neuronal subsets, the mushroom bodies and insulin producing cells (IPCs).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.61	23028662_171|23028662|29562|Discussion|0:0|Because of the simple projection pattern, low number of axons and high GFP expression in the membrane of the IPCs, we were able to observe an increase in axon diameter in the IPCs overexpressing Rheb.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.61	23028662_175|23028662|29562|Discussion|0:0|Additionally, although both the mushroom body neurons and the IPCs showed dramatic size increases due to Rheb overexpression, overexpression of Rheb or deletion of Tsc1 in other classes of neurons, such as the adult-specific neurons of the thoracic ganglia, did not (unpublished data).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.61	23028662_210|23028662|36255|Discussion|0:0|Since the OK107 driver is not expressed in the DPM neurons [33], [34], we hypothesize that the grossly enlarged morphology of the mushroom body axonal lobes is either preventing formation of a normal memory trace in the mushroom body, or preventing proper synaptic connectivity with the DPM neurons, resulting in lack of consolidation.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.64	22870182_208|22870182|34807|Discussion|0:0|The mechanism by which partitioning of thylakoid pmf is established and adjusted remains unclear, but in vitro experiments and modeling established that at least three factors are critical [24], [48], [51]: 1) the capacitance of the thylakoid membrane, which determines the Deltapsi generated for the transfer of a charge across the membrane; 2) the proton-buffering capacity of the lumen, which determines the relationship between translocated protons and changes in lumen pH; 3) the ionic composition of the stroma and lumen, which determines the degree to which transthylakoid counterion movements can dissipate the Deltapsi component.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

0.64	22167201_25|22167201|2173|Introduction|0:0|The human MBL oligomers include dimers and trimers and extend up to hexamers and octamers; the major forms of human MBL are also trimers and tetramers, whereas pentamers and hexamers occur in much lower amounts.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.63	22167201_394|22167201|59111|DISCUSSION|0:0|Small imperfections in the x-ray curve fits for the dimer, trimer, and tetramer were explained in terms of low amounts of the other oligomers that could not be removed by gel filtration.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

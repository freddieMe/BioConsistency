22291037_19|22291037|16348|#section_info|0:0|It has been reported that the N-terminal 561 residues of human BIG1 are sufficient for Golgi targeting in mammalian cells (Mansour et al., 1999). When the equivalent region of Sec71 was expressed in S2 cells, it showed only weak Golgi staining (Fig. 4 B). However, when it was coexpressed with Drosophila Arl1, this N-terminal region was efficiently recruited to the Golgi (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the region of Sec71 C terminal to the Sec7 domain was diffusely distributed in the cytosol, irrespective of Arl1 overexpression. This indicates that Arl1 recruits Sec71 to Golgi membranes, but it appears that Arl1's effects are augmented by additional interactions elsewhere in the protein.|#main_body|GO:0000042|protein targeting to Golgi|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Arl1(39745)|#gene_synonym

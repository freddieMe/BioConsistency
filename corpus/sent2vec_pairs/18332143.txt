0.62	18332143_151|18332143|27431|RESULTS|0:0|The three profiles were very similar (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that the nucleotide-bound state of D1 does not influence the cooperative Trp-476 fluorescence changes associated with ATPgammaS binding to D2.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

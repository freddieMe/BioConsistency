22574182_4|22574182|2660|#section_info|255:756|Here we show that Cyp301a1 is likely to possess an important function in the developing epidermis. RNAi knockdown of Cyp301a1, and a Cyp301a1 piggyBac element insertion mutant both result in adults with a cuticle defect. Histological analyses suggest a retention of larval epidermal cells down the central portion of the abdomen. As Cyp301a1 is a conserved P450 in insects, further investigations into Cyp301a1 function may reveal critical biochemical insights into the formation of the adult cuticle.|#main_body|GO:0008365|adult chitin-based cuticle development|#go_definition|NONE|GOA|Cyp301a1(36378)|#gene_synonym

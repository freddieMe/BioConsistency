The truncation increased the cooperativity of myosin S1-induced tropomyosin binding for short tropomyosins (TM5a and TM1b9a), but it was neutral for long isoforms (smTM and TM2).|#main_body|GO:0003779|actin binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tpm1(24851)|#gene_synonym

The equilibrium binding constants (Kapp) obtained by fitting the experimental points to the Hill equation (Eq. 1) are summarized in Table 1 and show that actin truncation reduced the isoforms' affinity by a factor ranging between 1.2 and 1.5. The cooperativity coefficient (alphaH) of TMs binding to F-actin-3 was slightly greater than that for the binding to F-actin. The only TM isoform which bound to F-actin-3 with lower cooperativity was TM2 (Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0003779|actin binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tpm1(24851)|#gene_synonym

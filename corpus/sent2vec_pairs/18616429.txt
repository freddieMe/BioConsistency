The mutant K308A was efficiently expressed at the cell surface, but displayed a complete absence of upper band, demonstrating that the presence of the upper band was not a requirement for cell-surface expression. Interestingly, the proportion of upper band present in the mutant K308C was much greater at the cell surface than in the total protein sample, suggesting that the high-molecular-mass form of this mutant was more efficiently expressed at the cell surface than the lower molecular mass forms.

0.67	18616429_169|18616429|30306|DISCUSSION|0:0|In summary, we have exploited alterations in complex glycosylation at Asn298, induced by subtle changes in receptor conformation, to demonstrate that the region encompassing Arg304-Ile314 in the rat P2X2 receptor is important both for maintenance of correct receptor conformation and ion-channel function, and that it is likely to be positioned near to the plasma membrane.|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym
0.66	18616429_4|18616429|139|abstract|0:0|Cysteine substitutions within this region also resulted in a significant reduction in the apparent molecular mass of receptors, due to loss of complex glycosylation at the nearby acceptor site Asn298, which was not seen for the C-terminal portion of pre-TM2 (Asp315-Ile328).|#main_body|#go_id|#go_term|#go_definition|#evidence_code|#evidence_type|#gene_name|#gene_synonym

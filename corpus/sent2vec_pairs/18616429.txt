18616429_2|18616429|10534|#section_info|793:1682|we performed cell-surface biotinylation assays to determine the proportion of mutant receptor expressed at the cell surface (Figure 2C). At the cell surface, the band profile of wild-type P2X2 was somewhat altered; it appeared that a greater proportion of uppermost band was present in this sample. The mutant K308A was efficiently expressed at the cell surface, but displayed a complete absence of upper band, demonstrating that the presence of the upper band was not a requirement for cell-surface expression. Interestingly, the proportion of upper band present in the mutant K308C was much greater at the cell surface than in the total protein sample, suggesting that the high-molecular-mass form of this mutant was more efficiently expressed at the cell surface than the lower molecular mass forms. The cell-surface expression of K308R was identical with wild-type (results not shown).|#main_body|GO:0009986|cell surface|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|P2rx2(114115)|#gene_synonym

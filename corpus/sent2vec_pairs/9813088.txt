It is possible to observe the  meiotic spindle in this way as contrast is provided by mitochondria that are also partitioned along its microtubules.  However, the development of immunolabeling techniques  for spermatocytes, and the recent availability of antibodies  against many essential components of the mitotic apparatus and the contractile ring have led us to re-examine the  meiotic phenotype. We now show that in addition to defects in spindle pole behavior and chromosome non-disjunction previously reported (Sunkel and Glover, 1988),  failure of cytokinesis can be seen throughout spermatogenesis. |#main_body|GO:0000910|cytokinesis|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|polo(40232)|#gene_synonym

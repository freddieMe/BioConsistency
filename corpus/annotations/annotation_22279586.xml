Under normal growth condition, root growth of fad2 is slightly impaired. Therefore relative root growth is examined. Root growth of Col-0, fad2, and fad2/FAD2 on medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl or mannitol relative to that on medium without NaCl or mannitol was examined. When grown under high salt or mannitol condition, root growth retardation of fad2 was greater than that of Col-0 and fad2/FAD2 at all concentrations of NaCl and mannitol tested (Fig. 5A-5C). Furthermore, in order to eliminate the inhibition of NaCl on germination, we also tested the root growth of Col-0, fad2, and fad2/FAD2 after germination. Four-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS medium plates supplemented with or without NaCl, and vertically cultured for six days. The root elongation of fad2 was also less than that of Col-0 and fad2/FAD2 (Fig. 5D). The greater root growth inhibition of fad2 indicated that under the imposed salt or mannitol stress conditions, fad2 is more sensitive to the stress treatment. The sensitivity of fad2 salt or osmotic stress was recovered by expression of FAD2 in fad2 mutant (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16158</offset><annotation id="22279586_25"><infon key="gene">FAD2(820387)</infon><infon key="go-term">regulation of sodium ion transport|GO:0002028</infon><infon key="goevidence">IMP</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="16321" length="460"/><text>When the seedlings were grown in the absence of NaCl, no significant differences were seen in the Na+ and K+ contents of wild-type and mutant plants (Fig. 7).

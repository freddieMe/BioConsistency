The present study carried out detailed mapping of this signal and further characterized the binding to elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1alpha) and other interacting proteins. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that shortening of a stem region proximal to nucleotides 66-76 abrogated binding. Full length recombinant rat eEF1alpha, and independently domains I and III, formed complexes with the mRNA. Proteins binding to biotinylated MT-1 3'UTR sequences were isolated using RNA-affinity techniques, and mass spectrometry identified histidine-tRNA ligase as one of the major MT-1 3'UTR binding proteins. We conclude that a 5-bp internal stem in the MT-1 3'UTR is critical for binding of eEF1alpha and histidine-tRNA ligase, and that binding of eEF1alpha is facilitated through domains I and III.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1080</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1093</offset><text>In eukaryotic cells the defined distribution of specific mRNA species to different regions of the cytosol provides a mechanism for localized synthesis of proteins close to their site of action [1,2]. In fibroblasts, the transcripts encoding beta-actin are transported to the cell periphery [3] whereas, in contrast, c-myc, c-fos, and metallothionein-1 (MT-1) mRNAs are retained around the nucleus [4-6]. This perinuclear localization of MT-1 mRNA is essential for nuclear localization of MT-1 protein in S phase and for the ability of MT-1 to limit DNA damage [7,8]. Thus, perinuclear localization of MT-1 mRNA appears to facilitate the subsequent import of the protein into the nucleus under appropriate conditions. Nuclear localization of MT-1 may, therefore, be physiologically important during transition from G1 to S phase, following cell stress induced by cytotoxic agents or following stimulation by nitric oxide [9-11].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2021</offset><text>In general mRNA localization is brought about by cis-acting signals within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) that interact with RNA-binding proteins [1,2,12]. Localized mRNAs appear to be transported in RNA granules where they are associated with several proteins [13,14]. The nature of such complexes remains to be defined. In the case of perinuclear mRNAs neither the precise nature of the signal within the 3'UTR nor the nature of the binding complex have been characterised. However, for MT-1 mRNA, there is evidence that the region of the 3'UTR between nucleotides (nt) 45 and 76, particularly nt 66-76, is required for localization [15]. This region contains CACC repeats and interestingly such repeats have been implicated in other localization signals [16,17]. Data derived from a combination of bioinformatic folding predictions and chemical cleavages indicate that this region is part of an internal stem-loop (see Fig. 1) and initial mutagenesis studies suggested that the secondary structure is important for localization [6]. This earlier study indicated that elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1alpha) binds to this region [6], and furthermore eEF1alpha has also been reported to bind to the localization signal of beta-actin mRNA [18]. To date neither the relative importance of the CACC repeat in combination with the stem-loop structure nor the domains of eEF1alpha required for this binding have been fully elucidated. Moreover, it is not known which proteins, in addition to eEF1alpha, are present as part of the localization complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3570</offset><text>This work carried out a systematic study of the role of the internal stem-loop region of the 3'UTR and the domains of eEF1alpha in MT-1 transcript-protein complex formation, and identified a further protein component of the complex.

The subcellular distribution of the transcript is facilitated by interaction with protein(s) binding to its 3'UTR. To characterise the significance of the CACC repeat and the stem-loop in these protein interactions, a series of mutant MT-1 transcripts were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The internal stem is predicted to contain 5 bp (nt 27-31 interacting with 66-70) as shown in Fig. 1. Based on this predicted structure four mutants were made in which, as shown in Fig. 2, the deletions were predicted by Mfold to shorten the stem by one, two or three base pairing nucleotides. Thus, the mutant pcMT-Delta31,66 was predicted to produce transcripts with a stem shortened by 1 bp: similarly the stem in MT-Delta30,31,66,67 was 2 bp shorter, and MT-Delta29-31,66-68 by three, whilst MT-Delta27,28,69,70 was predicted to remove 2 bp positioned proximal to the loop region. Two further mutants were made that were predicted to maintain a 5-bp stem but in which the CACC sequence in either the stem or the adjacent loop had been replaced. In MT-DS3 the CACC sequence in the stem region (nt 67-70) was substituted with CGGC and mutant MT-TS had the CACC sequences in both the stem region and loop region replaced with CGGC and CTTC, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10923</offset><text>EMSA demonstrated that wildtype MT-111 transcripts formed a complex with protein(s) in CHO cell S100, as previously described [6,15]. RNase T1 digestions following binding revealed several retarded complexes with a single major complex predominating (Fig. 3). The ability of the mutant transcripts to compete against the wildtype RNA (MT-111) for protein binding was assessed by competition EMSA using 80- to 160-fold molar excess of unlabelled mutant RNA species. Unlabelled MT-111 RNA was used as a positive competitor control and MT-Delta66-76 transcripts were used as a negative competitor control since the latter has been shown previously not to compete for binding [6]. Competition EMSA was performed with each of the various stem shortened mutants (Fig. 3A and B). In each case the competitor RNA failed to inhibit complex formation between MT-111 RNA and proteins from the CHO cell S100 fraction. Thus removal of bases 31:67, 30/31:66/67, 29/30/31:66/67/68 or 27/28:69/70 (Fig. 3A and B) resulted in an inability of the mutant transcript to bind to CHO proteins. Similarly, the mutant RNA where the CACC sequence in the stem had been substituted whilst retaining base pairing in the internal stem (MT-DS3) also failed to compete with MT-111 RNA for protein binding (Fig. 3C) Moreover, mutant RNA again retaining the internal stem but with both CACC repeats substituted (MT-TS) also failed to compete for binding. Thus, loss of the CACC domains also abrogated binding to CHO cell proteins. Overall, this data extends previous observations by indicating that the length of the stem is a critical feature determining specific protein binding; any shortening of this stem region destroyed the ability to interact with CHO proteins. The CACC sequence within this stem region is essential for binding since its substitution also destroys binding although the internal stem base pairing is retained. Since protein binding to this region has been correlated with mRNA localization [6,15] the data suggest that the internal stem and CACC repeat are critical features of the perinuclear localization signal.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13030</offset><text>Binding studies with recombinant eEF1alpha</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13073</offset><text>Previous studies have suggested that eEF1alpha in CHO cell extracts binds to the internal stem-loop localization signal in the MT-3'UTR [6]. However, it was not identified whether (i) eEF1alpha can bind RNA independently, (ii) whether eEF1alpha requires other proteins to successfully generate a binding complex, or (iii) if specific single or multiple domain(s) of eEF1alpha are responsible for RNA interactions. This study aimed to investigate these questions. Purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the full length eEF1alpha or independent sub-domains were generated and used in EMSA in conjunction with wildtype MT-111 transcripts. Incubation of full length recombinant eEF1alpha with MT-111 transcripts led to a retardation of the RNA, indicating formation of a complex. GST alone failed to generate this reduced mobility of the transcript and this was also true of domain II. Domains I and III interacted with the RNA as did the full length protein, generating a complex (Fig. 3D). Domain I generated a second complex of slower migration, suggesting that it may bind as a multimer. In comparison, the two major complexes formed between CHO S100 cell extract and the wildtype mRNA migrated more slowly in the gel than the complex formed with recombinant eEF1alpha. The migration of the complex generated by domains I, III and the full length protein is similar to one of the minor species from the EMSA with CHO cell S100 extract. These data suggest that the full binding complex comprises more than just eEF1alpha and that both domains I and III are independently capable of binding to MT-111 transcripts, but that domain II cannot bind.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14725</offset><text>Previous studies have identified that recombinant eEF1alpha binds to the 3'UTR of ss-actin mRNA [18] and that binding was facilitated by domains I and III. The results presented here also show that domains I and III are required for binding to MT-1 3'UTR. Interestingly, although these two mRNAs are localized to different regions of the cytosol they are both associated with the cytoskeleton [3,5], and in both cases it has been suggested that the mRNAs are anchored on microfilaments. Since eEF1alpha is a major actin-binding protein [20] it is possible that it may function to anchor mRNAs to the cytoskeleton. The present data and those of Liu et al. [18] suggest that it is domains I and III of eEF1alpha that are involved in binding to the mRNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15477</offset><text>Identification of binding complex proteins from CHO cell extract</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15542</offset><text>It was notable by EMSA using recombinant eEF1alpha that the complex formed was retarded less than the complex formed between the MT-111 RNA and CHO cell lysate (see Fig. 3D), suggesting that proteins other than eEF1alpha in the CHO cell lysate may also be involved in complex formation. In order to identify these proteins biotinylated MT-111 RNA was immobilized on streptavidin beads and used as bait to isolate interacting proteins from a CHO cell lysate. The interacting proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie staining revealed a number of proteins from the MT-111 transcript affinity column but not from the control column containing beads alone (Fig. 4). Four major species, with approximate molecular weights of 61, 57, 40 and 50 kDa, were excised from the gel and analysed by mass spectrometry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16363</offset><text>The analysis of the 50 kDa band identified it as eEF1alpha, consolidating previously published data [6]. The protein present in the ~57 kDa band (band 2 in Fig. 4) was identified as Chinese hamster histidine-tRNA ligase (Mowse score = 61, p &lt; 0.05), which with a molecular mass of 57 kDa closely matched the migration by SDS-PAGE. Thus, it appears that MT-111 transcripts interact directly, or via eEF1alpha, with histidine-tRNA ligase and are part of an RNP complex that contains several proteins. This finding of a second protein in the complex that has been previously identified to have a different function in protein synthesis, is consistent with the multifunctional nature of proteins that have been found to bind to localization signals [21-24]. It is also consistent with observations that components of the translational apparatus are co-transported with mRNAs [13,14] and that they too have been found to bind to localization signals in mRNAs [23,24]. SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluates from the RNA affinity column suggests that in addition to eEF1alpha and histidine-tRNA ligase, other proteins may be involved in complex formation. However, analysis by MALDI-TOF of the two further bands (bands 1 and 3 in Fig. 4) failed to reveal any significant match. Hence, further investigation is needed to identify these co-purifying proteins that may form critical members of the binding complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17763</offset><text>In conclusion, we postulate that eEF1alpha is capable of binding to a specific internal stem-loop region of the 3'UTR of MT-1 mRNA implicated in perinuclear mRNA localization and hypothesise that histidine-tRNA ligase is also a member of this binding complex. Fine mapping of the critical regions involved in complex formation shows that domains I and III of eEF1alpha protein are sufficient for recognition of a RNA motif in which both the 5-bp stem and CACC repeat sequence are essential. Although these domains of eEF1alpha can act independently to facilitate this binding, it is likely that other proteins are present in the RNP complex in vivo. Interestingly, eEF1alpha also binds to the zip-code sequence in actin mRNA and a stem-loop structure in the West Nile virus [3,18,25] and these motifs also contain an ACACC or CAC repeat suggesting that a combination of stem-loop structure and CAC repeat sequence is a conserved motif important in binding of eEF1alpha to specific transcripts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>18757</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">247</infon><infon key="lpage">256</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Jansen;given-names:R.P.</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">11283722</infon><infon key="source">Nat.

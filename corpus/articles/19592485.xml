Here, we report that stimulation of endogenous cAMP levels with either forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) or the V2 receptor agonist [deamino-Cys1,d-Arg8]vasopressin increases steady-state surface NKCC2 and that the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 blocks this effect. Confocal imaging of apical surface NKCC2 in isolated perfused TALs confirmed a stimulatory effect of cAMP on apical trafficking that was blocked by PKA inhibition. Selective stimulation of PKA with the agonist N6-benzoyl-cAMP (500 mum) stimulated steady-state surface NKCC2, whereas the Epac-selective agonist 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2'-O-methyl-cAMP (100 and 250 mum) had no effect. To explore the trafficking mechanism by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2, we measured cumulative apical membrane exocytosis and NKCC2 exocytic insertion in TALs. By monitoring apical FM1-43 fluorescence, we observed rapid stimulation of apical exocytosis (2 min) by forskolin/IBMX. We also found constitutive exocytic insertion of NKCC2 in TALs over time, which was increased by 3-fold in the presence of forskolin/IBMX. PKA inhibition blunted cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion but did not affect the rate of constitutive exocytosis. We conclude that cAMP stimulates steady-state apical surface NKCC2 by stimulating exocytic insertion and that this process is highly dependent on PKA but not Epac.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1779</offset><text>The renal-specific Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter NKCC2 is expressed at the apical membrane and in subapical vesicles in the thick ascending limb (TAL)2 of Henle's loop, where it mediates NaCl reabsorption (1).

PKA is expressed in TALs and binds cAMP in response to arginine vasopressin stimulation (14). In addition to PKA, the Epac isoforms Epac1 and Epac2 are expressed in TALs (15), but their role in NKCC2 trafficking has not been addressed. In the collecting duct epithelium, arginine vasopressin and cAMP stimulate aquaporin-2 exocytic insertion into the apical membrane and enhance water permeability (16) in a process mediated by PKA (17-20). However, Epac-selective agonists also enhance aquaporin-2 trafficking and apical exocytosis in this renal epithelium, suggesting a role for Epac1 (10, 21). In addition, in other cells, Epac-dependent signaling exerts opposite effects compared with PKA (22, 23). We hypothesized that cAMP increases steady-state surface NKCC2 expression in native TALs by stimulating apical exocytosis and that PKA mediates this process. Our data show for the first time that cAMP stimulates the rate of NKCC2 exocytosis via PKA and that this trafficking step mediates the increase in steady-state surface NKCC2 in native TALs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4290</offset><text>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4314</offset><text>Drugs</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4320</offset><text>Reagents for steady-state surface biotinylation and exocytic insertion protocols were from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

The difference between these two samples represents the NHS-acetate-masked surface NKCC2 fraction, which was used to express exocytic insertion over time.

After treatment of perfused TALs with vehicle or drugs in the absence or presence of H-89 (10 mum) at 37  C, protein trafficking was stopped by cooling TAL cells to 4  C, and apical membranes were labeled with anti-e-NKCC2 antibody (1:100 in 2.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) added to the lumen perfusate for 30 min at 4  C. The lumen was washed, and TALs were fixed while at 4  C with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin, followed by 20 min of apical labeling with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG highly cross-adsorbed at 1:200 in 2.5% bovine serum albumin. Undetectable labeling was observed in the absence of primary e-NKCC2 antiserum (data not shown). The e-NKCC2 antiserum was characterized previously in isolated perfused rat TALs (24). Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscopy system (Visitech International) with acousto-optical tunable filter-controlled argon laser (488 nm line) excitation. Fluorescence was measured with a 500-nm long-pass filter. Identical settings were used to obtain cross-section z-series images from individual TAL cells along a tubule. To diminish day-to-day variation, fluorescence intensity was regularly calibrated to a linear range using FocalCheck slides. Two-dimensional image analysis was used to measure fluorescence intensity in regions of interest encompassing the apical membrane of several cells in each image.

Thus, its intensity is directly related to membrane surface area and is used as an index of cumulative exocytosis (27, 28). Briefly, 2 mum FM1-43 was included in the luminal perfusate and exchanged for 30 s before imaging. FM1-43 was present in the flowing apical solution for the remainder of the experiment. Images were acquired via laser scanning confocal microscopy at a cross-section of labeled TALs along the z axis so that the apical membranes of TAL cells were in focus on both sides of the lumen. FM1-43 was excited with an acousto-optical tunable filter-controlled argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was collected with a 525-nm long-pass emission filter. Images were acquired for 100 ms, every 10 s. After a 10-min period with continuous FM1-43 perfusion, the dye was washed out from the lumen. We observed little endocytosis of FM1-43 prior to 10 min; however, subapical vesicles were visible after 10 min of incubation with the dye (data not shown).

To test this, we incubated TALs with H-89 in the absence and presence of forskolin/IBMX and then measured NKCC2 exocytic insertion for 30 min. Forskolin/IBMX stimulated NKCC2 exocytic insertion compared with vehicle-treated TALs (p &lt; 0.05), and H-89 blocked the stimulatory effect of forskolin/IBMX by almost 60% (p &lt; 0.02) (Fig. 6). Interestingly, constitutive NKCC2 insertion was not affected by PKA inhibition. These data indicate that PKA is involved in cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytosis but not in constitutive NKCC2 insertion into the apical membrane.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>25533</offset><text>cAMP increases the rate of NKCC2 exocytic insertion via PKA in TALs. TALs were masked with NHS-acetate and incubated at 37  C for 30 min with either vehicle or forskolin (20 mum) plus IBMX (0.5 mm) in the presence or absence of H-89 (10 mum). One aliquot was not masked with NHS-acetate to measure basal surface NKCC2 (not shown). After treatment, suspensions were cooled down at 4  C, and newly inserted NKCC2 was biotinylated. Surface NKCC2 was detected by Western blotting, and mean optical density was measured by densitometry. The difference between basal steady-state surface NKCC2 and NHS-acetate-masked samples was considered the NHS-acetate-masked NKCC2 fraction. Data are expressed as percent of the NHS-acetate-masked fraction over time as mean +- S.E.

However, the trafficking steps and the signaling cascade by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2 in epithelial cells were unknown. Here, we observed that PKA inhibition blocks cAMP-induced increases in steady-state surface NKCC2 when cAMP is increased by either forskolin/IBMX or the physiological agonist dDAVP in native TAL epithelium (Figs. 1 and 2). Consistent with a role of PKA, a PKA-selective agonist stimulated surface NKCC2 to similar levels compared with forskolin/IBMX, whereas the Epac-selective agonist 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2'-O-methyl-cAMP had no effect on surface NKCC2 (Fig. 3). The absence of an effect of the Epac analog may indicate that Epac is not involved in the stimulation of surface NKCC2 or that the concentration of agonist was not sufficient to stimulate Epac activity. However, the latter is unlikely because the concentration of Epac agonist used was higher than those reported to activate Epac in renal tubules (10, 12, 13) and polarized epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that during PKA inhibition with H-89, the Epac-selective agonist decreased surface NKCC2 by 20% (data not shown), suggesting an inhibitory role of Epac in NKCC2 trafficking to the membrane that may be masked by low PKA activation. Together, our data indicate that PKA mediates cAMP-induced stimulation of steady-state apical surface NKCC2 in TALs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27807</offset><text>The concentration of H-89 used here has been extensively validated for PKA inhibition (20, 30-33). In our experiments, 10 mum H-89 blocked 70-100% of the forskolin/IBMX effect in steady-state apical NKCC2 (Figs. 1 and 2). However, we observed only a partial blockade of cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytosis (Fig. 6). We think that this is due to differences in the incubation time with H-89 in the two protocols. In the exocytic insertion protocol, TALs were warmed in the presence of both H-89 and forskolin/IBMX, whereas for steady-state surface NKCC2 measurements, the PKA inhibitor was preincubated with H-89 before increasing cAMP. It is possible that this shortens the time required for H-89 to maximally inhibit PKA. Alternatively, it is possible that a fraction of cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion is mediated by a different cAMP-stimulated pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28663</offset><text>We also observed constitutive NKCC2 insertion under basal conditions (Fig. 5), suggesting that trafficking of NKCC2 to the apical membrane is a continuous dynamic process rather than an event triggered by cAMP. It is likely that constitutive endocytosis and recycling are involved in maintaining steady-state NKCC2 at the apical membrane. However, these processes appear not to be dependent on PKA activity because H-89 did not affect steady-state surface NKCC2 (Figs. 1 and 2) or the rate of exocytic insertion (Fig. 6). Although our data indicate that cAMP stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis, they do not exclude the possibility that cAMP affects endocytosis and recycling of NKCC2 and that these mechanisms also contribute to enhance apical membrane NKCC2 levels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29423</offset><text>The protein targets by which PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis are not known. Our previous data indicate that the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family of proteins is involved in NKCC2 trafficking because the stimulation of surface NKCC2 by cAMP was blocked by tetanus toxin (6). This neurotoxin blocks vesicle fusion by cleaving the SNARE proteins VAMP-2 and VAMP-3, both of which are expressed and co-localize with NKCC2 in TALs (6). Several proteins that modulate SNARE-mediated exocytosis such as snapin (34), tomosyn (35), complexin (36), and Munc18 (37) mediate PKA-stimulated exocytosis. Thus, we speculate that PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis by SNARE-dependent fusion and trafficking to the apical membrane of TALs. In addition to SNARE protein phosphorylation, rat NKCC2 possesses three predicted serine phosphorylation sites in its C terminus (4) that may serve as potential PKA targets. Although phosphorylation at these sites has not been described, N-terminal threonine phosphorylation is associated with enhanced activity (38), although the kinase involved (SPAK) appears to be unrelated to the cAMP pathway. The contribution of these pathways to NKCC2 exocytosis remains to be studied.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>30670</offset><text>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 HL080409-05 and P01 HL090550-01 (Subproject 2; to P.

Control of the NO concentration, therefore, is critical for proper brain function, but, although its synthesis pathway is well-characterized, the major route of breakdown of NO in brain is unclear. Previous observations indicate that brain cells actively consume NO at a high rate. The mechanism of this consumption was pursued in the present study. NO consumption by a preparation of central glial cells was abolished by cell lysis and recovered by addition of NADPH. NADPH-dependent consumption of NO localized to cell membranes and was inhibited by proteinase K, indicating the involvement of a membrane-bound protein. Purification of this activity yielded CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase). Antibodies against CYPOR inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes and the amount of CYPOR in several cell types correlated with their rate of NO consumption. NO was also consumed by purified CYPOR but this activity was found to depend on the presence of the vitamin E analogue Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid), included in the buffer as a precaution against inadvertent NO consumption by lipid peroxidation. In contrast, NO consumption by brain membranes was independent of Trolox. Hence, it appears that, during the purification process, CYPOR becomes separated from a partner needed for NO consumption. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes, making these proteins likely candidates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1731</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1744</offset><text>NO (nitric oxide) is an intercellular signalling molecule with a role in several neurophysiological functions, including the acute modulation of neuronal excitability, the longer-term synaptic changes associated with learning, and the development of the nervous system [1]. Its major physiological receptor is the NOGC (NO-activated guanylyl cyclase, also known by its homogenate-based name, soluble guanylyl cyclase), through which it stimulates the production of the second messenger cGMP. cGMP has numerous targets, including cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases, mediating the short- and long-term modulations of neuronal function [2,3].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2426</offset><text>These physiological pathways are engaged by low nanomolar concentrations of NO. The dynamic range of the NOGC receptor, as measured in intact cells, is between 0.1 and 10 nM NO [4-6], suggesting that this is the range of NO concentrations normally experienced by cells. Indeed, electrical stimulation of cerebellar brain slices yielded 4 nM NO, as measured by electrodes positioned at the slice surface [7]. Even lower NO concentrations may also be physiologically relevant, as NO-dependent phosphorylation events have been reported after exposure to sub-nanomolar NO concentrations [6].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3014</offset><text>At higher concentrations, NO may be linked with pathophysiology. NO inhibits the respiratory chain enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, with an IC50 of 60-120 nM at physiological oxygen concentrations [4,8], and micromolar NO levels can produce cell damage via reaction with superoxide and production of the highly oxidising species peroxynitrite [9].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3359</offset><text>Control of the amplitude and duration of changes in NO concentration is therefore likely to critically affect both the manner in which NO can act physiologically and also whether it has any pathological effects. The NO concentration experienced by a cell will be determined by the relative rates of NO synthesis and breakdown but, although the mechanism of NO synthesis from L-arginine is relatively well characterized, there is no known dedicated consumption pathway for NO in the brain, although a number of enzymes have been proposed to fulfil this function in other tissues [10-14]. One such protein is CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase), which is involved in an extremely avid NO consumption by a colorectal cancer cell line [15]. A process with similar properties [membrane localization and NAD(P)H dependence] has also been reported in cultured endothelial cells [16].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4239</offset><text>Previous work has revealed that brain tissue actively consumes NO [17-19]. In dissociated brain cells, part of the NO consumption was found to be caused by lipid peroxidation, which is likely to be of particular relevance to pathology, but inhibition of lipid peroxidation unmasked another consumption process [18]. The present study aimed to identify this mechanism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4607</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4629</offset><text>All compounds were purchased from Sigma (Poole, U.K.) unless otherwise stated.

Further study revealed that the critical component was Trolox, which concentration-dependently enabled NO consumption by purified CYPOR, whereas DTPA did not (Figures 3B and 3C). Other antioxidants, edaravone (500 muM) and phenothiazine (200 muM), could not sustain NO consumption by CYPOR (results not shown), indicating that this is a special property of Trolox rather than a general antioxidant effect.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>23538</offset><text>CYPOR requires a partner to inactivate NO</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>23580</offset><text>(A) Plateau NO concentrations following application of NADPH to 300 muM DETA/NO and purified CYPOR (100 m-units/ml) or brain membranes (2 mg of protein/ml)+-DTPA and Trolox (both 100 muM).

Solubilized membranes in the presence of Trolox could then be further purified to yield purified CYPOR, as described above.

The compounds (200 muM) did not affect CYPOR activity in the presence of Trolox (results not shown) but they both concentration-dependently reduced NADPH-dependent NO consumption by brain membranes (Figure 3D), suggesting that one or more cytochrome P450s may be involved.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25908</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25919</offset><text>In this study we present evidence that brain cells consume NO by a membrane-localized process that involves NADPH oxidation by CYPOR, a microsomal protein that transfers electrons from NADPH to an acceptor, classically a haem-containing cytochrome P450 [27]. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors decreased NO consumption by brain membranes, suggesting that reduction of these proteins by CYPOR underlies NO consumption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26329</offset><text>Cytochrome P450s perform hydroxylation reactions which, in the brain, are involved in diverse functions including steroid hormone synthesis, cholesterol homoeostasis and vitamin, eicosanoid and xenobiotic metabolism [28,29]. Both CYPOR and several members of the cytochrome P450 family are expressed in brain, though at much lower levels than in the liver (1-10%; [30]). Interestingly, NO has been shown to bind and inhibit several cytochrome P450s [31,32], making them intriguing candidates for NO consumption by brain membranes. Indeed, the reductase domain of NOS is very similar to that of CYPOR and performs an analogous function, donating electrons to the haem-containing oxygenase domain [27]. NO binding to the NOS haem domain inhibits its catalytic activity and NO can then be consumed here by reaction with O2 [33].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27155</offset><text>The CYPOR/cytochrome P450 system has been previously linked with NO consumption in a colorectal cancer cell line (CaCo-2 cells; Hallstrom et al. [15]) in which the authors suggest one of the following reaction schemes: 1) NO binding to cytochrome P450 haem-Fe2+ to form Fe2+-NO, which reacts with O2 to form nitrate and haem-Fe3+, or 2) O2 binding to the same haem-Fe2+, which reacts with NO to form nitrate and haem-Fe3+. In both schemes, NADPH/CYPOR then reduces the haem back to Fe2+ to continue the reaction cycle. Our finding that brain contains a similar NADPH/CYPOR-dependent NO consumption process suggests that this general mechanism plays a role in normal (non-cancer) cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27841</offset><text>The sensitivity of brain membranes to imidazole-derived cytochrome P450 inhibitors suggests that the operative cytochrome P450 is not likely to be CYPs 3A4, 2A6 or 2C19, which are much more sensitive to ketaconazole and clotrimazole [26]. The inhibition profiles found here are instead similar to those for CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 which are less sensitive to imidazole inhibition and are both expressed in the brain [26,34,35]. On a cautionary note, however, both clotrimazole and ketoconazole may affect proteins other than cytochrome P450s (e.g. K+ channels; [36]).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28402</offset><text>As CYPOR was able to consume NO in the presence of the soluble vitamin E analogue Trolox (but not other antioxidants), it is also possible that vitamin E is an additional endogenous partner for CYPOR in brain membranes. Vitamin E is highly lipid-soluble and its membrane location would be appropriate for interacting with CYPOR, a membrane protein. Unfortunately, the high lipid solubility of vitamin E makes it very difficult to explicitly test for this relationship. Attempts to incorporate vitamin E and CYPOR into brain membranes and reconstituted phospholipid vesicles were not effective in enhancing NO consumption activity (results not shown), but we were unable to positively control for their successful incorporation, so cannot exclude a role for vitamin E. Endogenous vitamin E levels can be manipulated by dietary means, but this procedure also affects levels of cytochrome P450s and other proteins [37], so would not clarify the issue.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29351</offset><text>The mechanism by which Trolox, CYPOR and NADPH together support NO consumption is unclear. Flavins in the nitric oxide synthase reductase domain (which is analogous to CYPOR) can pass electrons to molecular O2 to produce superoxide [38]. In the bulk solution this will be dismutated by SOD to hydrogen peroxide but it is possible that at the active site, NO could react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a very reactive molecule that could oxidize the protein structure. Possibly Trolox could then recover enzymatic activity by reducing the relevant residues. Alternatively, Trolox can be oxidized to a quinone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [39], produced by SOD, and Trolox-quinone can then be reduced by NADPH to a semiquinone which readily reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide [40]. As above, superoxide could react directly with NO or alternatively, NO itself may be directly reduced by quinones or flavins. Which, if any, of these mechanisms underlies the Trolox-dependent NO consumption remains unclear. Before pursuing it further, the physiological relevance of this process to that observed in brain membranes and intact cells needs to be clarified, bearing in mind that the lack of Trolox-dependence in brain membranes indicates that the Trolox effect may be an artifact.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30646</offset><text>NADPH-dependent NO consumption in brain is somewhat less active than in CaCo-2 cells. In the latter, the rate of NO consumption at 1 muM NO was 4 nmol/min per mg of protein, or 4 muM/min at 1 mg of protein/ml. In brain membranes, the rate constant for NO consumption is 0.59 min-1 per mg of protein (see Table 1 and calculations in the legend), so at 1 mg of protein/ml and 1 muM NO, the rate of NO consumption is 0.59 muM/min, almost 7-fold lower than in CaCo-2 cells. That CaCo-2 cells are more active than brain is consistent with the relative expression levels of the CYPOR/cytochrome P450 systems: low in brain [30] but relatively high in the gastrointestinal tract [41] and in cancer cells and cell lines [42,43]. This pattern is consistent with the results showing a correlation between CYPOR activity and NO consumption in different cell types (Figure 2A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table_title_caption</infon><offset>31511</offset><text>Rate constants for NO consumption by brain tissue</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>31561</offset><text>The rate of NO consumption at steady-state is equal to the rate of NO release from DETA/NO and is therefore given by the equation:  The stoichiometry of NO release from DETA/NO is 1.6, as measured in this laboratory [19] and t1/2 is the half-life of DETA/NO (20.5 h at 37  C).

An additional component, possibly a cytochrome P450-like protein or a vitamin E-like compound, also appears to be needed. The absence of an effect of DPI on cGMP levels and, by extension, NO levels in slices of rat cerebellum [44] may suggest a limited role for this process in intact cerebellum. However, seeing that the NADPH-dependent responses in cerebellar glia are smaller than in forebrain synaptosomes (see Figures 1C and 1D), regional or cellular differences may exist. Examination of this possibility and more direct measurement of NO levels within intact brain tissue are needed to clarify the role of the NO inactivation pathway in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>33002</offset><text>Online data</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>33014</offset><text>FUNDING</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33022</offset><text>This work was supported by the  [grant number ] and the  [grant number ].

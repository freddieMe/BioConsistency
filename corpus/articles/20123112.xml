However, the mechanism of SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection is yet to be fully understood. Adenoviral SUR2A construct (AV-SUR2A) increased SUR2A expression, number of KATP channels and subsarcolemmal ATP in glycolysis-sensitive manner in H9C2 cells. It also increased K+ current in response to chemical hypoxia, partially preserved subsarcolemmal ATP and increased cell survival. Kir6.2AFA, a mutant form of Kir6.2 with largely decreased K+ conductance, abolished the effect of SUR2A on K+ current, did not affect SUR2A-induced increase in subsarcolemmal ATP and partially inhibited SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection. Infection with 193gly-M-LDH, an inactive mutant of muscle lactate dehydrogenase, abolished the effect of SUR2A on K+ current, subsarcolemmal ATP and cell survival; the effect of 193gly-M-LDH on cell survival was significantly more pronounced than those of Kir6.2AFA. We conclude that AV-SUR2A increases resistance to metabolic stress in H9C2 cells by increasing the number of sarcolemmal KATP channels and subsarcolemmal ATP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1323</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1336</offset><text>Cardiac sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are gated by intracellular ATP and are viewed as a link between cellular metabolism and membrane excitability. These channels are closed under physiological conditions and are opened only during ischaemia, which protect the myocardium against ischaemic damage. Structurally, sarcolemmal KATP channels in vivo are composed of an inward rectifier, Kir6.2 and Kir6.1, SUR2A, an ATP-binding protein, and accessory proteins that are glycolytic and ATP-producing enzymes [reviewed in 1]. Recently, it has been shown that cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing KATP channel regulatory subunit, SUR2A, acquire resistance against hypoxia and other types of metabolic stresses. The mechanism of SUR2A-mediated cardioprotection seems to be associated with increased numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels, earlier activation of KATP channels during stress, shortening of the action membrane potential and consequent decrease in Ca2+ influx [2]. It should be, however, said that in some recent studies a mechanism of cytoprotection afforded by KATP channels independent from the channel activity was reported. More specifically, it has been suggested that enzymes that are physically associated with KATP channel subunits regulate subsarcolemmal/intracellular ATP levels, which, in turn, promotes cellular survival under metabolic stress [3-5]. It is therefore possible that SUR2A-mediated cardioprotection has a component in addition to the increased channel activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2857</offset><text>Therefore, we have undertaken this research to elucidate the channel-dependent and channel-independent mechanisms of SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection. It has been shown that rat heart embryonic H9C2 cells are good experimental model to study SUR2A, KATP channels and cardioprotection [6]. As an example, these cells have been used to uncover the effect of increased SUR2A expression on cellular response to metabolic stress [7,8], which was shown to correspond to adult hearts exposed to hypoxia [2]. Here, we have generated adenovirus containing gene encoding SUR2A and tested the effect that this construct has on survival of H9C2 cells exposed to severe metabolic stress. We have elucidated the mechanism underlying SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection and found out that there is more to the cardioprotection by SUR2A than previously thought.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3694</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>3702</offset><text>H9C2 cells and viral constructs</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3734</offset><text>H9C2 cell rat embryonic heart H9c2 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) were cultured in a tissue flask (at 5% CO2) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine. For electrophysiological experiments, the cells were plated on a 35 x 10-mm culture dish containing 25-mm glass cover-slips. The cells were cultured in incubators (Galaxy, oxygen control model, RS Biotech, Irvine, UK). For the experiments H9C2 cells were infected with adenoviral constructs containing either green fluorescent protein (GFP, gift from C. Sunderland, University of Dundee; cells infected with GFP have served as control cells in this study), gly193-M-LDH (a catalytically inactive mutant of M-LDH, [9], Kir6.2, or Kir6.2AFA (a mutant form of Kir6.2 where the pore GFG was mutated into AFA leading to largely reduced K+ conductance, [10]). When intracellular and subsarcolemmal ATP levels were measured cells were infected with adenovirus containing luciferase and annexin VI-luciferase genes respectively. All these adenoviruses were generated and used as described in details in [4,5]. The recombinant SUR2A adenovirus (AV-SUR2A) was generated using the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene). SUR2A gene was cloned into a shuttle vector pShuttle-CMV by PCR using the following primers containing restrict enzyme sites Bgl II/Xho I, sense, 5'-GCAGATCT GGC AGG CTG TTG GTA GCT CA-3', antisense, 5'-GCCTCGAG CTA CTT GTT GGT CAT CAC CA-3. The positive clones containing DNA inserts were linearized with Pme I and transformed into BJ5183-AD-1 competent cells to perform homologous recombination in Escherichia coli between the shuttle vectors carrying SUR2A gene and a large adenovirus containing plasmid following electroporation. Recombinants were identified from single colonies, linearized, and then transfected into HEK293 cells to produce infective adenovirus virions. Adenoviral particles were obtained by cell extraction after 7-10 days of transfection, and the primary virus was further amplified by infection of AD-293 cultures, amplified virus stock is prepared by 4 rounds of freeze/thaw. The virus titer is determined using QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To infect H9C2 cells, a solution of recombinant adenovirus was mixed with culture medium, and cells were exposed to the virus with a multiplicity of 10 viral particles/cell for 48 h.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6198</offset><text>Real time RT-PCR</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6215</offset><text>Total RNA was extracted from heart of rat H9C2 cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Extracted RNA was further purified by RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat primers for all KATP channel subunits were designed as depicted on Table 1. All KATP channel subunits were measured using these primers apart on SUR2A that was measured by combining SUR2A rat (Table 1) and mouse (sense: ACTATGGAGTCCGAGAACTA, antisense: AGGTTTGGACCAGTATCACA) primers. The structural similarity between mouse and rat SUR2A is 93%, but the primers used for mouse SUR2A do not recognize RAT SUR2A and vice versa. Therefore, we have used mouse SUR2A to make adenoviral construct, so that we can examine the level of adenoviral SUR2A expression in host H9C2 cells. To measure total SUR2A mRNA levels we have combined both sets of primers. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was carried out with ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK). A final volume of 20 microl of RT reaction containing 4 microl of 5x buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 U of RNasin  Ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 U of ImProm-II reverse transcriptase, 0.5 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.5 microg of oligo(dT), and 1 microg of RNA was incubated at 42  C for 1 h and then inactivated at 70  C for 15 min. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for real time PCR. A SYBR Green I system was used for the RT-PCR and the 25 microl reaction mixture contained: 12.5 microl of iQ  SYBR  Green Supermix (2x), 7.5 nM each primers, 9 microl of ddH2O, and 2 microl of cDNA. In principle, the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95  C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s of denaturing at 95  C, 15 s of annealing at 56  C, and 30 s of extension at 72  C. The real time PCR was performed in the same wells of a 96-well plate in the iCycler iQ  Multicolor Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Data was collected following each cycle and displayed graphically (iCycler iQ  Real-Time Detection System Software, version 3.0A, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primers were tested for their ability to produce no signal in negative controls by dimer formation and then with regard to the efficiency of the PCR reaction. Efficiency is evaluated by the slope of the regression curve obtained with several dilutions of the cDNA template. Melting curve analysis tested the specificity of primers. Threshold cycle values, PCR efficiency (examined by serially diluting the template cDNA and performing PCR under these conditions) and PCR specificity (by constructing the melting curve) were determined by the same software. Each mouse cDNA sample was measured at three different quantities (and duplicated at each concentration, the corresponding no-RT mRNA sample was included as a negative control (blank). To determine relative mRNA expression (normalised to the wild type) we have used glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a control gene. The calculation of relative mRNA expression was performed as described [11]. The relative expression ratio (R) of SUR2A is calculated using equation R = (EK)DeltaCPK(WT-TG)/(ER)DeltaCPR(WT-TG) where EK is the real time PCR efficiency of SUR2A gene transcript, ER is the real time PCR efficiency of GAPDH gene, DeltaCPK is the crossing point deviation of wild type-transgene (infected) of SUR2A gene transcript while DeltaCPR is the crossing point deviation of wild type-transgene of GAPDH gene transcript.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9780</offset><text>Patch clamp electrophysiology</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9810</offset><text>To monitor whole cell K+ current the gigaohm seal patch clamp technique was applied in the perforated-patch whole cell configuration.

All pipettes (resistance 3-5 MOmega), were filled with (in mM): KCl 140, MgCl2 1, HEPES-KOH 5 and amphotericin B (Sigma, 240 mug/ml) (pH 7.3). For all cells monitored, the membrane potential was normally held at - 40 mV and the currents evoked by a series of 400 ms depolarising and hyperpolarising current steps (- 100 mV to + 80 mV in 20 mV steps) recorded directly to hard disk using an Axopatch-200B amplifier, Digidata-1321 interface and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Forster City, CA). The capacitance compensation was adjusted to null the additional whole cell capacitative current. The slow capacitance component measured by this procedure was used as an approximation of the cell surface area and allowed normalisation of current amplitude (i.e. current density). Currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 100 mus intervals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10942</offset><text>Cell survival assay</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10962</offset><text>The survival of H9C2 cells was assayed using Multitox-Fluor Multiplex Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega).

After a 48 h infection, the DNP was added to each well at the final concentration of 10 mM. To measure cell survival 6 h later, the peptide substrate (GF-AFC) that can be cleaved only by live cells was added to the each well. Following a 30 min-long incubation at 37  C, plates were measured using 1420 Multibabel Counter (Victor) plate reader, with excitation at 370 nm and emissions of 480 nm. The percentage of live cells was calculated based on the intensity of fluorescence according to the manufacturer's instructions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11845</offset><text>Luciferase assay</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11862</offset><text>H9C2 cells were co-infected with adenoviruses containing genes encoding luciferase (to measure total ATP) or annexin-luciferase (to measure subsarcolemmal ATP) together with adenoviruses containing genes encoding KATP channel-forming proteins (as named in the Results section) 48 h before luciferase assay. To measure luciferase luminescence cells were mounted in 96-well plate in buffer with the following composition (in mM): 30 HEPES, 3 ATP, 15 MgSO4, 10 DTT; pH: 7.4. Some of the cells were untreated while the others were treated with 10 mM DNP. The reaction for luciferase luminescence measurement was initiated by adding 100 muM of luciferin and the luminescence was measured on a plate reader 1420 Multibabel Counter (Victor). Luminescence was measured in the absence of DNP and after 1 h of cell incubation with 10 mM DNP. To validate that annexin-luciferase- and luciferase-mediated signal reflect subsarcolemmal and cytosolic ATP respectively, cells were infected with either luciferase, annexin-luciferase or GFP (control), harvested after 48 h and plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions were obtained as described in [7]. The presence/absence of plasma membrane in a fraction was verified by 5-nucleotidase assay. Luminescence was measured as described above; in membrane and cytosolic fractions (both spiked with 5 mM ATP) of cells infected with annexin-luciferase the luminescence signal was 6956 AU/mg protein and 480 AU/mg protein respectively. These results demonstrated that targeted expression of luciferase to membrane was successful and that signal in vivo reflects mostly the level of ATP in environment surrounding the plasma membrane. On the other hand, in cells infected with luciferase, luminescence was 1030 AU/mg protein in cytosolic fraction and 670 AU/mg protein in membrane fraction showing ubiquitous distribution of luciferase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13725</offset><text>Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13762</offset><text>The cells were homogenised in buffer (TRIS 10 mM, NaH2PO4 20 mM, EDTA 1 mM, PMSF 0.1 mM, pepstatin 10 mug/ml, leupeptin 10 mug/ml, at pH = 7.8) and centrifugated at 500 g (to remove large particles from the homogenate).

Using this strategy, we measured only those Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits that physically assemble in sarcolemma to form a channel. Western blot has demonstrated that the level of myocardial SUR2A protein was increased in H9C2 cells in comparison to control cells (Fig. 1).

In this particular phenotype SUR2A expression was under control of CMV promoter, which is the promoter used in AV-SUR2A in this study as well. Under CMV promoter SUR2A mRNA in hearts of transgenic animals was increased for ~ 6 times in comparison to the wild type [2], which is similar to those in H9C2 cells achieved by AV-SUR2A. This modest up-regulation of SUR2A has resulted in increased number of sarcolemmal KATP channels, which is in accord to what has been observed in transgenic CMV-SUR2A phenotype [2]. It should be mentioned that a transgenic phenotype overexpressing SUR2A by action of alphaMHC promoter has decreased the number of sarcolemmal KATP channels [23]. However, as opposed to infected H9C2 cells, in the phenotype described by Flagg et al. mRNA SUR2A levels were increased by ~ 50 times. It has been reported that cardiac Kir6.2 mRNA levels are physiologically ~ 30 times higher than those values of SUR2A [2]. How this transpose into difference at protein level is not yet known, but it is likely that some difference between protein levels also exist. It is therefore possible that stimulating expression of SUR2A over the levels of Kir6.2 expression would suppress the functional expression of KATP channels from optimized dimeric SUR2A/Kir6.2. A similar idea about the regulation of KATP channel numbers has been put forward by Flagg et al. [23] and this could explain why a moderate, but not extreme, increase in SUR2A levels results in increased number of sarcolemmal KATP channels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27438</offset><text>DNP is a known metabolic inhibitor that was used in many studies to induce metabolic stress in different cell types [18]. When applied, this compound induces chemical hypoxia, which activates KATP channels [24]. In turn, such activation of the channels decreases a degree of cell injury [13]. The finding that DNP-induced K+ current was increased in cells infected with SUR2A is in accord with these cells having increased number of sarcolemmal KATP channels. An increase in sarcolemmal KATP channels is associated with increased myocardial resistance to metabolic stress [7,8,25]. However, there is a report suggesting that a lack of SUR2A, but not Kir6.2 [26], generates a cardiac phenotype with increased resistance to ischaemia/reperfusion [27]. Most recently, this has been explained by the presence of a short SUR2A form in mitochondria when it plays a cardioprotective role that remained unaffected in SUR2A knockout phenotype [28]. On the other hand, transgenic mice with moderately increased expression of SUR2A also acquire resistance to metabolic stress, which was explained by increase in numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels and earlier channel activation in response to metabolic stress [2]. Here, we have shown that an acute increase in SUR2A expression confers cytoprotection, which would be in accord with reports associating increased SUR2A with the cardioprotective outcome [29].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28837</offset><text>The mechanism of cytoprotection afforded by KATP channels is a long-standing issue. It is predominant view that the activation of the channel is required for KATP channels to protect the heart against metabolic stress [30]. How opening of sarcolemmal KATP channels protect the heart against metabolic stress is still to be fully understood. It is traditional view that the activation of KATP channels shortens action membrane potential resulting in decreased influx of Ca2+ and prevention of Ca2+ overload [30]. However, it has been shown that the activation of KATP channels is protective in cells that do not generate action membrane potential, including diastolic cardiomyocytes [14-16]. More recently, we have suggested that cytoprotection afforded by KATP channels could also involve a channel activity-independent mechanism [4,5]. Specifically, it has been found that inhibition of the catalytic activity of M-LDH, an enzyme physically associated with sarcolemmal KATP channels [9], results in decreased ATP levels as well as inhibited KATP channels-mediated K+ current in response to stress. The inhibition of both the channel activity and ATP production had much more pronounced effect on cell survival than a sole inhibition of channel activity [4,5]. Based on these findings, it was concluded that production of ATP by sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex is a significant part of the mechanism underlying KATP channel-mediated cardioprotection. In the present study, we have shown that increase in SUR2A expression increases subsarcolemmal ATP levels even under control conditions. This would support the notion that sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex produces ATP and that this property could be important even under physiological conditions. The structural studies of KATP channels have shown that channel subunits in vivo are physically associated with enzymes that catalyses ATP production, most of them being involved in glycolysis [9,12,22]. Such composition of sarcolemmal KATP channels would allow a supposition that KATP channel protein complex could serve as ATP-producing machinery in the sarcolemma. To test hypothesis that production of ATP by glycolytic enzymes physically associated with KATP channel subunits mediates the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP, we have used 2-deoxyglucose, a known inhibitor of glycolysis. Treatment with this compound abolished the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP showing that glycolysis is essential for the observed SUR2A effect. This would be in agreement with the idea that ATP produced by glycolytic enzymes physically associated with KATP channel subunits underlies SUR2A-mediated increase in subsarcolemmal ATP levels. The fact that SUR2A counteracted DNP-induced loss of subsarcolemmal ATP further supports our hypothesis that fully assembled KATP channel protein complexes might serve as an ATP producer in vivo. It would be logical to expect that more subsarcolemmal ATP would support ion homeostasis by providing energy for active transport processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31877</offset><text>As opposed to Kir6.2AFA that inhibits KATP channels permeability without affecting subsarcolemmal ATP levels, 193glyM-LDH has effects on both the channel activity and subsarcolemmal ATP [4]. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tetramer composed of either M (muscle) and/or H (heart) subunits, which may be combined to form five LDH isozymes. In the heart, all LDH isozymes are present; LDH1 (H4) is the predominant form, whereas LDH5 (M4) is present in trace amounts [31]. It has been shown that M-LDH, but not H-LDH, physically associates with Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits and is integral part of the sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex [9]. DNP is a known inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, but the mechanism of DNP-induced activation of sarcolemmal KATP channels is less associated with decrease of intracellular ATP and more with increase in intracellular lactate levels and acidification [32-35]. It seems that lactate directly targets and activates KATP channels despite the presence of high intracellular levels of ATP while low pH counteract the channel inhibition induced by ATP [36]. It has been demonstrated, at the both recombinant and native levels, that M-LDH physically associated with KATP channels is required, by virtue of its catalytic activity, for the channel opening during metabolic stress [4,5,9]. It has been suggested that M-LDH-produced lactate 1) targets and activates KATP channels and 2) decreases the channel sensitivity to inhibitory effect of ATP [36,37]. At the same time M-LDH activity contributes to the ATP production. The expression of 193glyM-LDH, a catalytically inactive form of M-LDH, has been shown to inhibit both M-LDH properties to activate KATP channels (by producing lactate) and counteract DNP-induced decrease in subsarcolemmal ATP. Here, we have shown that infection with 193glyM-LDH abolishes SUR2A-mediated increase in K+ current as well as increase in subsarcolemmal ATP levels. This finding is in accord with our hypothesis that infection with AV-SUR2A has increased the number of sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complexes that are both important for subsarcolemmal ATP levels and K+ current in response to metabolic stress. An increase in subsarcolemmal ATP and KATP channel activation might look as a contradiction. However, it is known that ischaemia opens sarcolemmal KATP channels before the fall of intracellular ATP occur [38], suggesting that the intracellular level of ATP is not the only factor that regulates the channel activity. In addition to ATP, it has been suggested that the activity of these channels may be regulated by other nucleotides, intracellular pH, lactate, cytoskeleton, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and by the operative condition of the channel itself [39]. It is well established that lactate activates KATP channels in the presence of millimolar ATP, though the mechanism of this activation is yet unknown [9]. Therefore, it is quite possible that M-LDH catalytic activity results in both increase in subsarcolemmal ATP (the effect of ATP production) and KATP channel activity (the effect of lactate production). How significant is increase in subsarcolemmal ATP for SUR2A-mediated cell survival was assessed by comparing the effect of DNP in cell expressing SUR2A/Kir6.2AFA (inhibited channel activity without changes in subsarcolemmal ATP) and cells expressing SUR2A/193glyM-LDH (inhibited channel activity as well as increase in subsarcolemmal ATP). It has been found that, unlike Kir6.2AFA, expression of 193glyM-LDH abolished cytoprotection induced by SUR2A and had a deleterious effect on cell survival under DNP. The fact that 193glyM-LDH was more efficient in inhibiting SUR2A than Kir6.2AFA supports our hypothesis that infection of H9C2 cells with AV-SUR2A led to increased numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels, increase in subsarcolemmal ATP and increased K+ current in response to metabolic stress. An increase in subsarcolemmal ATP following infection with SUR2A seems to be the major mechanism of SUR2A-mediated cardioprotection. It is also worthwhile mentioning that cell survival after concomitant infection with SUR2A and Kir6.2 was not statistically different from those in cells infected with SUR2A alone. This is compatible with idea that SUR2A level is the rate limiting factor in regulating numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels and cell resistance to metabolic stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36288</offset><text>In conclusion, this study has shown that infection with SUR2A increases resistance to metabolic stress in H9C2 cells.

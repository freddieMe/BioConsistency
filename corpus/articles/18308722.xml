Phosphorylation sites for CK2 are located in the C terminus of both  beta- and gamma-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC).  We examined the role of CK2 on the regulation of both endogenous ENaC in  native murine epithelia and in Xenopus oocytes expressing rENaC. In  Ussing chamber experiments with mouse airways, colon, and cultured  M1-collecting duct cells, amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport was  inhibited dose-dependently by the selective CK2 inhibitor  4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB). In oocytes, ENaC currents were also  inhibited by TBB and by the structurally unrelated inhibitors heparin and  poly(E:Y). Expression of a trimeric channel lacking both CK2 sites  (alphabetaS631AgammaT599A) produced a largely  attenuated amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance and rendered the mutant  channel insensitive to CK2. In Xenopus oocytes, CK2 was translocated  to the cell membrane upon expression of wt-ENaC but not of  alphabetaS631AgammaT599A-ENaC. Phosphorylation by  CK2 is essential for ENaC activation, and to a lesser degree, it also controls  membrane expression of alphabetagamma-ENaC. Channels lacking the Nedd4-2  binding motif in beta-ENaC (R561X, Y618A) no longer required the CK2 site  for channel activity and siRNA-knockdown of Nedd4-2 eliminated the effects of  TBB. This implies a role for CK2 in inhibiting the Nedd4-2 pathway. We propose  that the C terminus of beta-ENaC is targeted by this essential, conserved  pleiotropic kinase that directs its constitutive activity toward many cellular  protein complexes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1787</offset><text>Electrogenic Na+ absorption across the apical membrane of  epithelia utilizes an amiloride-sensitive channel  (ENaC)4 composed of  three (alphabetagamma) subunits produced from different genes  (6). In kidney-collecting duct,  distal colon, airway, secretory ducts from a variety of organs, and the  absorptive sweat duct, ENaC is regulated by an interaction between the beta-  and gamma-subunits (at their C terminus) and the E3-ubiquitin ligase  Nedd4-2. The WW domains of Nedd4-2 bind proline-rich PY (PXXY) motifs  in each ENaC subunit leading to channel ubiquitination, internalization, and  degradation and hence channel inactivation  (7,  17). Nedd4-2 interaction with  ENaC is positively and negatively controlled by phosphorylation of either  Nedd4-2, or the C termini of both beta- and gamma-ENaC. Accordingly, the  aldosterone-induced serum and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase, Sgk-1,  phosphorylates Nedd4-2 on serines (Ser) 444 and 338, thereby reducing its  interaction with the channel and causing enhanced ENaC activity  (7,  23). Apart from this, Sgk-1  also phosphorylates alpha-ENaC directly at Ser-621, causing a stimulatory  effect on the channel, which appears to be Nedd-4-2-independent  (8). Protein kinase A (PKA),  which is known to activate ENaC in alveolar epithelial cells, sweat duct, and  kidney, was also shown to phosphorylate Nedd4-2 (at serine residues 221, 246,  and 327) and to reduce binding to ENaC  (22). Moreover, PKA prevents  inhibition of ENaC by preventing beta-ENaC phosphorylation at threonine  (Thr) 613 by the extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk)  (26). Indeed, phosphorylation  of Thr-613 in beta-ENaC and Thr-623 in gamma-ENaC were previously shown to  increase channel affinity toward Nedd4-2, thereby down-regulating channel  activity (20).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3581</offset><text>Thus, differential phosphorylation of both beta- and gamma-ENaC  subunits can either enhance or reduce its affinity for Nedd4-2, thereby  controlling its degradation and hence the channel activity. Along this line,  the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Grk2) was found recently to  upregulate the activity of ENaC in salivary duct cells  (9). Grk2 acts at the C  terminus of beta-ENaC phosphorylating Ser-633, i.e. twenty amino  acids downstream of Erk. Grk2 increases the activity of ENaC by rendering the  channel insensitive to Nedd4-2  (9). Notably, an increased Grk2  activity has been reported to be associated with hypertension in humans and in  animal models (11). Therefore,  imbalance in ENaC channel regulation by activatory or inhibitory pathways may  lead to inappropriate Na+ absorption, hypertension, or cystic  fibrosis (15).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4427</offset><text>Additional phosphorylation sites at the C terminus of the beta- and  gamma-subunits of ENaC include those for the pleiotropic but essential  protein casein kinase 2 (CK2)  (21). It has been demonstrated  that CK2 specifically binds to and phosphorylates the C termini of both these  ENaC subunits. As found for the Grk2 site (Ser-633) in beta-ENaC, a pair of  CK2 phosphorylation sites (betaSer-631 and gammaThr-599) are located in  close proximity to their respective PY motifs. CK2 is not easy to study, as  siRNA approaches invariably impact on a number of targets in multiple  pathways, some of which coupled to its essential function for cell survival.  In a previous study, no contribution of CK2 to regulation of ENaC was observed  following the mutation of single putative CK2 sites  (21). Notwithstanding, we  investigated a role for CK2 on ENaC function in native epithelia from airway  and colon as well as in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat ENaC. We found  that constitutive CK2 phosphorylation not only maintains ENaC active, but it  also controls the membrane expression of its subunits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5528</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5550</offset><text>Ussing Chamber Experiments:Tracheas and distal colon were  removed from mice euthanized by ethically approved institutional procedures  (C57BL/6, Charles Rivers, Germany).

In Ussing chamber experiments,  we explored CK2-selective concentrations of the specific inhibitor TBB, which  was shown to have no effect on over 30 other kinases. TBB selectivity depends  on its ability to bind an unusual hydrophobic ATP binding site that differs  from the equivalent in conventional kinases. Electrogenic Na+  transport in mouse trachea was assessed by inhibition of ENaC with amiloride  (10 mum) (Fig.  1A). TBB (10 mum) reduced the  transepithelial voltage Vte and attenuated amiloride-sensitive  short-circuit currents (Isc-amil) in a dose-dependent manner  (Fig. 1, A and  B). Similarly, TBB significantly blocked  amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in mouse distal colon  (Fig. 1, C and  D). This effect could be reproduced in cultured mouse  M1-collecting duct cells, grown on permeable supports  (Fig. 1, E and  F). These combined results suggest that endogenous  epithelial Na+ channels expressed in epithelial tissues are  maintained in an active state by constitutively active CK2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14539</offset><text>To further confirm regulation of epithelial Na+ channels by CK2,  the three (alphabetagamma)-ENaC subunits were expressed in  Xenopus oocytes and examined in double electrode voltage clamp  experiments. As shown in the original recording in  Fig. 2A, the  simultaneous expression of the three ENaC subunits produced a large current,  which was inhibited by amiloride (A, 10 mum). The CK2 structure  is virtually identical in Xenopus compared with mammals. Thus, TBB  (10 mum) also significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive whole  cell currents and conductance (Gamil), respectively  (Fig. 2, A and  B) in oocytes. Another compound, DMAT, has recently been  shown to inhibit CK2 with higher inhibitory potency, but it has limited  efficacy in vivo due to its rapid  turnover.5 At 2  mum, we did not observe inhibition of ENaC currents by DMAT in  Xenopus oocytes; however, 5 mum reduced  amiloride-sensitive ENaC conductance significantly from 31.9 +- 6.8 to  25.7 +- 4.1 muS(n = 5). Regulation of ENaC by CK2 was further  validated using the structurally unrelated peptide inhibitor of CK2, poly(E:Y)  and conversely, by activating CK2 with polylysine (poly(K))  (16,  24). The peptides were  injected into oocytes at final concentrations between 10 and 100  mum, and amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductances were  compared before and 1-5 h after injection. During these few hours, ENaC  conductance increased, almost doubling initial values in water-injected  controls (Fig. 2), This  time-enhanced Na+ conductance was nevertheless inhibited by  poly(E:Y) and was further activated through stimulation of CK2 by poly(K)  (Fig. 2C). CK2 is  known to associate with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). To confirm  phosphorylation-dependent activation of ENaC, ooctyes were exposed to okadaic  acid at a PP2A-specific concentration (10 nm), which further  increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport  (Fig. 2, D and  E). Thus ENaC appears to be stimulated by constitutively  active CK2 with counter-regulation by PP2A-like inhibition. To further confirm  this activation by CK2, injection of the nonspecific CK2 inhibitor heparin (10  mum) also reduced Na+ conductance in Xenopus  oocytes (Fig. 4C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>16728</offset><text>Elimination of CK2 phosphorylation sites on ENaC inhibits channel  activity.

ENaC contains two phosphorylation sites for CK2, in  beta-ENaC (serine 631) and gamma-ENaC (threonine 599). Changing both CK2  sites to alanines (alphabetaS631AgammaT599A)  virtually eliminated Na+ conductance and rendered residual  conductance of the double mutant channel insensitive to TBB  (Fig. 3, B and  D). Trimeric Na+ channels carrying only one  mutation in either beta-ENaC (alphabetaS631Agamma) or  gamma-ENaC (alphabetagammaT599A), produced more measurable  but still significantly attenuated Na+ conductances when compared  with wt-ENaC (Fig.  3E). Moreover, the remaining amiloride-sensitive  Na+ conductances formed by dimeric alphabeta-ENaC and  alphagamma-ENaC channels were further reduced by betaS631A  and gammaT599A, respectively  (Fig. 3F). Finally,  coexpression of hCK2 together with wt-ENaC increased Gamil  (65.9 +- 9.0 muS; n = 7), when compared with injection of  wt-ENaC alone (47.2 +- 8.1 muS; n = 7).

The appearance of  alphaFlag-ENaC in the cell membrane was monitored by  chemiluminescence, during an observation period of 40-48 h  (Fig. 4, B, D, and  F and Fig.  5A, see &quot;Materials and Methods&quot;). Control  injection with non-flagged ENaC did not produce a chemiluminescence different  from background (data not shown). In parallel, amiloride-sensitive  Na+ conductance was assessed at corresponding intervals  (Fig. 4, A, C, and  E). When alphaFlagbetagamma-ENaC was  expressed in control oocytes, both Gamil and membrane  expression continuously increased (Fig. 4,  A and B). In contrast, when oocytes were kept in  10 mum TBB-containing buffer, amiloride-sensitive Na+  conductance was completely abolished, and membrane expression was  significantly reduced, albeit not completely. Moreover, co-injection of  alphabetagamma-ENaC-cRNAs together with the CK2 inhibitors heparin  (final concentration 10 mum) or the peptide inhibitor poly(E:Y)  (final concentration 50 mum) also inhibited Na+  conductance along with membrane expression of alpha-ENaC  (Fig. 4, C-F).

Of note,  TBB reduced alpha-ENaC expression only when one CK2 site was intact.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23920</offset><text>The nearby located Grk2 phosphorylation site Ser-633 was reported to  control Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC  (9). We explored whether the  same might hold true for CK2 phosphorylation sites. To this end, we compared  whole cell conductances of several ENaC mutants to that of wt-ENaC. A mutation  in the Nedd4-2 binding site (betaY618A) increased ENaC whole cell  conductance relative to the wild type and eliminated the inhibitory effect of  S631A on ENaC conductance (Fig.  5B). This strongly suggests that CK2 phosphorylation at  Ser-631 antagonizes the inhibitory action of Nedd4-2 in ENaC  (20)  (Fig. 8). Similarly, when we  expressed the truncated alphabetaR561Xgamma-ENaC channel, we  found that amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance was largely increased  (64.5 +- 5.9 muS; n = 14) when compared with  alphabetagamma-ENaC, and was now unaffected by 10 mum TBB  (64.1 +- 6.1 muS). Interestingly, mutating the Grk2 site also reduced  ENaC conductance; however, eliminating both CK2 and Grk2 sites in beta-ENaC  produced a channel with similar activity to that of wt-ENaC  (Fig. 5B). This  suggests that the closely located phosphorylation sites of CK2 and Grk2  (Ser-631, Ser-633) influence each other.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25129</offset><text>The role of Nedd4-2 on CK2 regulation of ENaC was further examined by  siRNA-knockdown of xNedd4-2, similar to a recent study  (Fig. 5C)  (18). Two remarkable results  were obtained, namely: (i) wt-ENaC was no longer inhibited by TBB. (ii)  alphabetaS631Agamma-rENaC, which normally produced only small  amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance, generated a whole cell  conductance that was indistinguishable to that obtained for wt  alphabetagamma-rENaC (Fig.  5C). These effects were not observed when scrambled RNAi  was injected. The contribution of Nedd4-2 to CK2 regulation of ENaC was  further examined in mammalian cells. M1 cells were grown on permeable supports  after treatment with RNAi for mCK2, mNedd4-2, or scrambled RNAi, or as  nontransfected control cells (Fig.  5D). Knockdown of CK2 and Nedd4-2 was verified by Western  blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). Isc-amil was enhanced in M1 cells  following Nedd4-2 knockdown, and inhibition by TBB was largely reduced  (Fig. 5D). In  contrast, CK2 knockdown reduced Isc-amil and also abolished the  effect of TBB on Isc-amil (Fig.  5D). Taken together, these results suggest that CK2  phosphorylation of ENaC antagonizes the inhibitory effects of Nedd4-2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>26341</offset><text>CK2 is not essential for membrane expression of beta-ENaC  and gamma-ENaC.

Membrane expression of beta-ENaC and gamma-ENaC was monitored by injecting  alphabetaFlaggamma-ENaC or  alphabetagammaFlag-ENaC, respectively, and Na+  conductances were measured in parallel. Na+ conductances generated  by either alphabetaFlaggamma-ENaC or  alphabetagammaFlag-ENaC, respectively, were almost completely  abolished when oocytes were exposed to 10 mum TBB, while membrane  expression of betaFlag and gammaFlag were reduced by  about 50% (Fig. 6A).  We further examined whether betaFlag and gammaFlag  behave in a similar fashion in the absence of alpha-ENaC. Dimeric channels  formed by betaFlaggamma-ENaC or  betagammaFlag-ENaC produced small but detectable  amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductances (0.74 +- 0.2 muS;  n = 8 and 0.2 +- 0.1 muS; n = 7, respectively).  Interestingly expression of betaFlag-ENaC and  gammaFlag-ENaC in dimeric and trimeric channels was similar, but  expression of both subunits in the dimeric channel was not affected by TBB  (data not shown). This suggests a complex role of alpha-ENaC for expression  of betagamma-ENaC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28252</offset><text>To further assess the impact of CK2 phosphorylation on membrane expression  of beta-ENaC and gamma-ENaC in trimeric  (alphabetaFlaggamma-ENaC and  alphabetagammaFlag-ENaC) channels, we expressed single  mutants (alphabetaS631A-Flaggamma-ENaC or  alphabetagammaT599A-Flag-ENaC) and double mutants  (alphabetaS631A-FlaggammaT599A-ENaC or  alphabetaS631AgammaT599A-Flag-ENaC) in the absence  or presence of 10 mum TBB. For all mutant combinations,  Na+ conductances were largely reduced in comparison to that of  wt-ENaC, and residual conductances generated by the double mutants were  insensitive to TBB (Fig. 6, B and  C). In contrast, the membrane expression of beta-ENaC  and gamma-ENaC was not affected by any of the mutations individually, and  membrane expression of the double mutants  (alphabetaS631A-FlaggammaT599A-ENaC;  alphabetaS631AgammaT599A-Flag-ENaC) was no longer  inhibited by TBB (Fig. 6, B and  C). These data suggest that when CK2 sites are present in  beta-ENaC and gamma-ENaC, they need to be phosphorylated to allow proper  membrane expression of all three subunits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29341</offset><text>ENaC Translocates CK2 to the Cell Membrane:It has been  reported that CK2 binds directly to ENaC  (21). This suggests that CK2  may be translocated by ENaC to the cell membrane as found for CFTR  (24). Oocytes expressing ENaC  and non-injected control oocytes were immunolabeled, after embedding and  cutting into 20-mum sections. Using an anti-FLAG antibody, alpha-ENaC  could be visualized in membranes of Xenopus oocytes expressing  alphaFlagbetagamma-ENaC  (Fig. 7A). Moreover,  upon expression of alphabetaFlaggamma-ENaC or  alphabetagammaFlag-ENaC, beta- and gamma-subunits could  be immunolabeled in the oocyte membrane  (Fig. 7B, left  panels). Expression of the three subunits was similar in  alphabetaS631AgammaT559A-ENaC-injected oocytes  (Fig. 7B, right  panels). However, while CK2 was detected in membranes of oocytes  expressing wt-ENaC, no membrane staining of CK2 was detectable in  alphabetaS631AgammaT559A-ENaC-injected oocytes  (Fig. 7B, lower  panels).

CK2  is believed to insert into protein complexes bringing its constitutive  activity to many signaling complexes (p53, ion channels, actin capping at  membranes, lipid flippases, etc). Notably, CK2 controls trafficking and  sorting of trans-Golgi proteins. CK2 affects a number of membrane channels and  pumps, among them is polycystin-2 (PC2), a divalent cation-selective channel.  CK2 was shown to maintain the Ca2+ sensitivity of PC2. Elimination  of a CK2 site in PC2 reduced its Ca2+ sensitivity, without changing  membrane expression (5). Others  reported the importance of phosphorylation of PC2 by CK2, for proper ciliary  localization of the channel  (13). CK2 also phosphorylates  three critical serine residues within nephrocystin, another ciliary protein.  CK2 phosphorylation is essential for co-localization of nephrocystin with the  sorting protein PACS-1 at the base of cilia. Inhibition of CK2 was shown to  eliminate interaction of PACS-1 and nephrocystin and to induce defective  nephrocystin targeting (19).  CK2 may thus be relevant to the common autosomal form of polycystic kidney  disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>31711</offset><text>wt-ENaC translocates CK2 to the cell membrane.

Experiments  were performed in at least triplicates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32175</offset><text>We found here that ENaC is regulated by CK2 in a related manner,  i.e. CK2 regulates ENaC activity as well as membrane expression. Lack  of CK2 phosphorylation appears to reduce Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC, thereby  enhancing channel activity and membrane expression. Notably, phosphorylation  of ENaC by ERK inhibits both channel activity and membrane expression, and  both effects are mediated by Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC  (10).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32601</offset><text>CK2 has also been described to influence other ion channels, namely by  regulating the current amplitude of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels  (14), as well as the  Ca2+-dependent gating of small conductance  Ca2+-activated K+ channels  (4). SK channels are organized  in multiprotein complexes together with CK2 and PP2A, located in the  postsynaptic pole of cochlear outer hair cells  (4). Furthermore, CK2 has  recently been found to regulate CFTR, the chloride channel that is defective  in cystic fibrosis and, as in this study, CK2 becomes membrane-associated with  CFTR (24). Once again both CK2  and PP2A co-localize with different domains of CFTR  (16,  24). Importantly, CK2 binding  may be disease relevant because phenylalanine 508 (F508), the common missing  residue in most patients with CF, is critical in promoting the interaction  with CFTR. In both CFTR-expressing Xenopus oocytes and cell-attached  mammalian cells, inhibition of CK2 induced prompt closure of CFTR in less than  80 s (24). However, direct  phosphorylation of CFTR by CK2 at Ser-511 close to F508 has not been confirmed  by radiolabeling cells and direct phosphopeptide mapping, and the exact  mechanism remains unknown. Moreover, CFTR expression determines the cellular  localization of CK2, which in turn could affect other membrane conductances  such as amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption. It is interesting to  note that the effect of CK2 is not stimulatory of the function of all proteins  studied to date. Indeed, CK2 is inhibitory of another ABC family member,  ABCA1; thus, constitutively suppressing the lipid flippase activity of this  CFTR-related protein.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34252</offset><text>C Terminus of beta-ENaC, a Target for Kinase Regulation of  ENaC:Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ENaC by CK2 is  demonstrated in the present study by several agents, namely, heparin, a  nonspecific inhibitor of CK2 directed against acidic motifs; the peptide  inhibitor of CK2; poly(E:Y); and the specific CK2 inhibitors TBB and DMAT.  Inhibition of protein phosphatases with okadaic acid further increased  Na+ conductance, indicating the importance of basal CK2-dependent  phosphorylation for ENaC regulation  (3). Furthermore, elimination  of CK2 phosphorylation sites (Ser-6331) abrogated Na+ conductance  in Xenopus oocytes. Thus, together with results obtained in native  epithelia and in epithelial cells, these data show that ENaC is compellingly  regulated by CK2 (Fig. 8).  Notably, CK1 was shown recently to control intracellular trafficking of ENaC  (25). Yet, in a previous  report such regulation could not be detected in salivary duct cells  (9). Instead, activation of  ENaC by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 Grk2 was found. Because of  phosphorylation of Ser-633 by Grk2 in the C terminus of beta-ENaC, the  affinity of Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC is apparently reduced, thus enhancing ENaC  currents. According to the present data  (Fig. 5B), a similar  scenario may hold true for CK2-dependent regulation of ENaC, because both  phosphorylation sites for Grk2 and CK2 are located in close proximity to one  other. Because CK2 classically engages in hierarchical phosphorylation with  other kinases, phosphorylation through either Grk2 or CK2 could control EnaC  activity and membrane expression depending on the cell type and expression  levels of the kinases involved. Moreover, phosphorylation by CK2 is likely to  affect regulation by Grk2 and vice versa  (Fig. 5B). Further  experiments will be needed to unravel this complex regulatory network and  should focus on the inhibitory phosphorylation by Erk and its counteraction by  activation through PKA, Grk2, and CK2, with Nedd4-2 as the central control  switch (1,  9,  20,  26). As suggested in a  previous report and supported by the present data, acute and chronic  regulation may be different, inasmuch as acute regulation is changing the open  probability of the channel, while chronic regulation by Nedd4-2 controls  membrane expression (10).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>36588</offset><text>Model for CK2 action on ENaC.

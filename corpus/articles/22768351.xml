Information about the function of essential nematode-specific genes provides insight to key nematode-specific processes that could be targeted with drugs. We have characterized the function of a novel, nematode-specific Caenorhabditis elegans protein, VHA-19, and show that VHA-19 is essential in the germline and, specifically, the oocytes, for the completion of embryogenesis. VHA-19 is also involved in trafficking the oocyte receptor RME-2 to the oocyte plasma membrane and is essential for osmoregulation in the embryo, probably because VHA-19 is required for proper eggshell formation via exocytosis of cortical granules or other essential components of the eggshell. VHA-19 may also have a role in cytokinesis, either directly or as an indirect effect of its role in osmoregulation. Critically, VHA-19 is expressed in the excretory cell in both larvae and adults, suggesting that it may have a role in osmoregulation in C. elegans more generally, probably in trafficking or secretion pathways. This is the first time a role for VHA-19 has been described.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1314</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1327</offset><text>Parasitic nematodes are a significant burden on human health [1] and cause large losses to agriculture [2]. Nematode-specific genes are of interest because they may provide selective drug targets for treatment of parasitic nematodes, or highlight essential pathways in these important organisms. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model in which to study nematode-specific genes because its genome is fully sequenced and well annotated (unlike many of the parasitic nematodes of interest), and it is easy to manipulate experimentally. We identified VHA-19 in a screen for essential nematode-specific proteins in C. elegans. VHA-19 satisfied the criteria of the screen because it had less than 30% sequence identity over 150 amino acids to any mammalian proteins; it had 30% or greater sequence identity to predicted proteins from nematode parasites; and had a reported maternal sterile and lethal phenotype when gene expression was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) [3], [4], [5].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2339</offset><text>This work shows that VHA-19 has a role in C. elegans reproduction. The reproductive system of the C. elegans hermaphrodite consists of two U-shaped gonad arms that each terminate with a spermatheca, connecting to a central uterus. Oocytes and spermatozoa are generated from the primordial germ cell, which resides at the distal end of each gonad arm and proliferates by mitosis. The proliferation of the primordial germ cell is controlled by the distal tip cell (Kimble &amp; White, 1981). Hermaphrodite C. elegans produce sperm during the fourth larval (L4) stage, and switch to producing oocytes in early adulthood. Oocytes migrate from the distal gonad and line up in the proximal gonad where they are squeezed one by one through the spermatheca. Once fertilized in the spermatheca, the embryo is passed into the uterus and subsequently laid via the vulva. The egg hatches into the first larval stage, and the worm progresses through four larval stages in total before moulting into the adult hermaphrodite. Male C. elegans also occur; they exclusively produce sperm and are capable of mating with hermaphrodite C. elegans. When this occurs, male sperm are used preferentially [6], [7].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3525</offset><text>In addition to reproduction, we also demonstrate that VHA-19 is involved in osmoregulation and osmotic support of the embryo. The embryo is considered protected from osmotic shock by the inner lipid layer of the eggshell [8], which is thought to be formed by the extrusion of cytoplasmic granules [9]. Osmotic support is important for early cytokinesis in the embryo, particularly in hypertonic or hypotonic media [10]. A lack of osmotic protection can lead to cytokinesis defects [10].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4012</offset><text>Here we show that VHA-19 is essential in C. elegans oocytes for the production of viable progeny and in early larval development. Within the oocyte, VHA-19 is involved in the trafficking of the oocyte receptor protein RME-2 to the plasma membrane. Since some vha-19(RNAi) embryos appear to be fertilized but are osmotically sensitive, we also hypothesize that VHA-19 is required for integrity of the eggshell and, possibly also cytokinesis, in the early embryo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4474</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4482</offset><text>Key Features of VHA-19</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4505</offset><text>VHA-19 is a 451 amino acid protein (www.wormbase.org) for which the bioinformatics applications TMPred [11] and HMMTOP [12] predict a transmembrane domain between amino acids 408-426.

In agreement with this hypothesis, no vha-19(RNAi) embryo hatched into larvae if it was laid beyond 24 hours of exposure to dsRNA (Table 2), and beyond this time point nearly all vha-19(RNAi) adults had switched to producing compressed eggs (Figure 1B). Thus, in addition to post-embryonic larval development, expression of vha-19 is also required for early embryogenesis and/or earlier events in C. elegans reproduction.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9275</offset><text>VHA-19 is Required in the Germline for Embryogenesis</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9328</offset><text>To determine whether vha-19 expression was required exclusively in the germline for the production of normal embryos, we silenced vha-19 expression in rrf-1 mutant C. elegans [NL2098]. RRF-1 is essential for RNAi in somatic tissue, but is not required for RNAi in the germline [15]. Similar to wild type C. elegans adults fed vha-19 dsRNA (Figure 1A), 94% (n = 83) of rrf-1; vha-19(RNAi) adults had compressed eggs present in their uterus after feeding on dsRNA for 24 hours from L4 (Figure 1C) whereas the compressed-egg phenotype was almost absent (1%; n = 76) in rrf-1; control(RNAi) adults (Figure 1C). This implies that VHA-19 has an essential role in the germline, because silencing expression of vha-19 in the oocytes and/or sperm alone was sufficient to induce the compressed-egg phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10127</offset><text>A Sperm Defect in vha-19(RNAi) Adults is Unlikely to Explain the Presence of Compressed Eggs</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10220</offset><text>Given that vha-19 expression is required in the germline, we examined the spermatozoa, oocytes and process of ovulation in more detail in vha-19(RNAi) adults to identify abnormalities.

We therefore examined the ability of these spermatozoa to trigger ovulation, which occurs via the secretion by sperm of major sperm protein [16], [17].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10764</offset><text>The rate of ovulation in vha-19(RNAi) adults was investigated by counting the number of eggs laid every 24 hours. As oocytes must pass though the spermatheca to be laid (whether fertilized or not), comparing the average number of eggs laid between individual control(RNAi) and vha-19(RNAi) worms allowed the rate of ovulation to be determined, and thus, whether there was a backup in the oviduct of vha-19(RNAi) worms. Interestingly, the average number of eggs laid by vha-19(RNAi) adults was not significantly different from control(RNAi) adults in the first 24 hours of exposure to dsRNA (p&gt;0.05; Figure 2A), but was significantly lower than the number of eggs laid by control(RNAi) worms in the subsequent time periods (p&lt;0.001; Figure 2A). This indicates that the rate of ovulation was not reduced in the time period where compressed eggs were first observed in the uterus of vha-19(RNAi) worms (0-24 hours; Figure 1B), but was reduced in subsequent time periods. There are three possible explanations for this: first, while the sperm that were observed in the spermathecae of vha-19(RNAi) worms at the 24 hour time-point (Figure 1D) were probably able to trigger ovulation normally, vha-19(RNAi) oocytes may have been released at a slower rate beyond this time point. Second, there may have been fewer sperm in the spermatheca of vha-19(RNAi) adults overall, which would result in the rate of ovulation decreasing more quickly in vha-19(RNAi) adults. Third, vha-19(RNAi) oocytes may have become less responsive to sperm in the later time periods.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>12316</offset><text>vha-19(RNAi) adults produce fewer oocytes beyond 24 hours of exposure to vha-19 dsRNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12403</offset><text>A) The average number of eggs laid every 24 hours by control(RNAi) or vha-19(RNAi) adults feeding on dsRNA.

This was the case for both wild type C. elegans and H2B::GFP C. elegans [AZ212] fed vha-19 dsRNA (Figure 2B) (H2B::GFP C. elegans were used to better visualize the nuclei of individual oocytes). This suggests that the rate of oocyte production declines prematurely in vha-19(RNAi) adults and explains why fewer eggs were laid by vha-19(RNAi) adults compared with control(RNAi) adults in the 48-72 hour time period (Figure 2A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14188</offset><text>Not only did the rate of oocyte production decline in vha-19(RNAi) adults compared with control(RNAi) adults; the oocytes also exhibited uncontrolled replication (endomitosis) (Figure 2C). As early as the 24-hour time point, when the rate of oocyte production did not differ between the experimental groups (Figure 2A), a significantly greater number of vha-19(RNAi) adults had endomitotic oocytes in the oviduct compared with control(RNAi) adults (p&lt;0.0001; Figure 2D). Endomitotic oocytes were visualized as oocytes with multiple nuclei, or oocytes in which the chromosomes had begun to decondense, indicating that nuclear envelope breakdown had occurred [18] (Figure 2C). Endomitotic oocytes were also present in the oviducts of vha-19(RNAi) adults at the 48-hour time point, at a higher frequency (Figure 2D). These observations suggest that some vha-19(RNAi) oocytes are defective before fertilization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15096</offset><text>Collectively, the requirement of vha-19 expression in the germline for normal embryogenesis (Figure 1C), the decline in oocyte production (Figure 2A-B), and the presence of endomitotic oocytes in the oviducts of vha-19(RNAi) adults (Figure 2C-D), suggest that VHA-19 has an essential role in the development of the oocytes. To confirm this, a mating experiment was designed. Virgin female fog-2 C. elegans [CB4108], which do not produce sperm and, thus, are unable to reproduce without mating [19], were fed on vha-19 or control dsRNA and mated with male fog-2 C. elegans fed control or vha-19 dsRNA.

Hence fog-2; control(RNAi) males were capable of siring normal progeny.

Vitellogenins are lipid-binding proteins, synthesized in the intestine, that are secreted as yolk granules from the intestine into the pseudocoelom (body cavity), where they diffuse into the gonad via pores in the somatic gonadal sheath cells [21], [22].

This observation is in agreement with results from a genome-wide screen in which vha-19(RNAi) embryos were scored as having a general osmolarity defect which was further described as &quot;embryo fills eggshell&quot; [25].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24300</offset><text>vha-19 was recently identified as a candidate gene in a screen for permeable embryos [26]. Thus vha-19(RNAi) embryos might be osmotically sensitive because their eggshells were permeable. Rappeleye and colleagues [27] have shown that permeability of the embryo can reflect a defect in the lipid layer of the eggshell. While 11% (n = 136) and 34% (n = 71) of vha-19(RNAi) embryos were permeable to Trypan Blue after 24 hours and 48 hours of exposure to dsRNA, respectively, the majority of isolated vha-19(RNAi) embryos were impermeable. Hence the lipid layer may be intact. However, many vha-19(RNAi) embryos laid after 48 hours of exposure to dsRNA disintegrated in the medium when they were isolated, which may have represented a population of vha-19(RNAi) embryos that were permeable. We therefore determined whether vha-19(RNAi) embryos in the uterus were permeable to the dye Acridine Orange at this late time point. These in utero embryos were permeable (Figure 4D), suggesting that VHA-19 may be involved in the secretion of the lipid layer of the eggshell in the embryo. However, as most vha-19(RNAi) embryos laid at earlier time points were impermeable, it is possible that the contents of the uterus of vha-19(RNAi) adults after longer periods of exposure to dsRNA represented unfertilized eggs, which would have lacked the permeability barrier. It is also possible that mechanical pressure in the uterus rendered vha-19(RNAi) embryos permeable.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>25756</offset><text>vha-19(RNAi) Embryos Exhibit Signs of Defective Cytokinesis</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25816</offset><text>An intact eggshell is important for early cytokinesis events in the embryo [27], [28], [29]. In particular, successful cytokinesis in wild type embryos requires an impermeable eggshell to provide protection from osmotic pressure: embryos with permeable eggshells exhibit cytokinesis defects in hypotonic and hypertonic media, but not in isotonic media [10]. Because vha-19(RNAi) embryos had a defect in osmoregulation in addition to being osmotically sensitive (Figure 4C), we hypothesized that they may exhibit cytokinesis defects as well. We found that eggs cut out of the uteri of vha-19(RNAi) adults had multiple nuclei that varied in number from two upwards (Figure 4A-B,E-F). Interestingly, some vha-19(RNAi) embryos resembled the dead embryos produced when expression of a known subunit of the C. elegans V-ATPase, vha-8, was silenced [30]. In 11% (n = 91) of isolated vha-19(RNAi) embryos, furrows were present that randomly separated clusters of nuclei (Figure 4F), which were never observed in control(RNAi) embryos. These furrows resembled cytokinesis defects observed when wild type embryos with permeable eggshells were placed in hypotonic media [10], as well as cytokinesis defects described in rab-11(RNAi) embryos [31] and syn-4(RNAi) embryos [32], which are genes involved in the secretory pathway and membrane fusion, respectively. Interestingly, a polar body was clearly visible for a small proportion of vha-19(RNAi) embryos (Figure 4E), indicating that they were fertilized and that cytokinesis of the oocyte pronuclei had successfully occurred.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>27383</offset><text>Tissue Expression Pattern of VHA-19</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27419</offset><text>Since vha-19(RNAi) embryos were osmotically fragile and exhibited osmoregulation defects, we determined whether vha-19 mRNA is expressed in tissues that control osmoregulation.

These are tissues in which other known osmoregulation genes are expressed [33]. We could not detect vha-19 expression in the germline (Figure 5), but transgenes are often silenced in the C. elegans germline [34], [35]. Indeed, there is consistent evidence from genome-wide expression studies that vha-19 is both maternally and embryonically expressed [36], [37], [38] and in two recent studies vha-19 mRNA has been detected in the germline [39] and in germline precursor cells [40].

This role somewhat resembles the described role of known V-ATPase subunits in C. elegans reproduction [30], [41], which is consistent with the hypothesised association between VHA-19 and the C. elegans V-ATPase. As well as the oocytes, VHA-19 is likely to have an important role in the developing embryo. This is because most vha-19(RNAi) embryos were clearly fertilized, as indicated by the presence of an eggshell (Figure 4A), which forms after fertilisation, and, in some embryos, a polar body (Figure 4E). Despite being fertilized, these embryos failed to complete embryogenesis. We therefore hypothesize that in this case a post-fertilization defect occurred during formation of the eggshell and/or cytokinesis, because vha-19(RNAi) embryos were osmotically fragile and responded abnormally to osmotic media (Figure 4B-C), and because some vha-19(RNAi) embryos resembled those observed by others when a cytokinesis defect occurs (Figure 4E-F) [32].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30735</offset><text>There are likely to be two explanations for the compressed eggs observed in the uterus of vha-19(RNAi) adults (Figure 1A). Eggs laid by vha-19(RNAi) adults after 24 hours of exposure to dsRNA are likely to be compressed because the structure of their eggshell is compromised, as indicated by their osmotic sensitivity (Figure 4B-C) and their compressed nature (Figure 4A). Eggs laid by vha-19(RNAi) adults after longer periods of exposure to dsRNA (and observed in the uterus) are likely to be compressed because the oocytes were defective, and so may not have been fertilized. In support of this explanation, eggs observed in the uterus of vha-19(RNAi) adults after 48 hours of exposure to dsRNA had often mixed together and could not be distinguished individually (e.g. Figures 1C, 4D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31524</offset><text>An explanation for the osmosensitivity of, and general osmoregulation defect observed in, vha-19(RNAi) embryos could be that VHA-19 is involved in the trafficking of cortical granules. These form in developing oocytes and are exocytosed in anaphase I of oocyte meiosis, shortly after oocytes are activated by major sperm protein [42]. Disrupted trafficking of cortical granules results in embryos with defective eggshells and osmolarity defects [42], as observed in vha-19(RNAi) embryos (Figure 4B-C). Further, as VHA-19 was required for proper trafficking of the receptor RME-2 in oocytes (Figure 3B), and RME-2 is trafficked via the secretory pathway, a role for VHA-19 in the traffic or exocytosis of cortical granules is possible.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32259</offset><text>If VHA-19 were involved in a secretory pathway this could be relevant to cytokinesis as well, as regression of the cleavage furrow can occur when secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is inhibited in embryos [31] and when hemicentin (a protein that is secreted into the pseudocoelom from the intestine) is absent from the germline [43]. Interestingly, when embryos fail to complete cytokinesis in the early stages of embryogenesis, nuclear division continues, resulting in embryos with multiple nuclei that are not cellularized [29], [44], which was observed for vha-19(RNAi) embryos (Figure 4A-B,E-F). Thus, is it possible that VHA-19 may be important for cytokinesis via a role in the secretory/trafficking pathway. Alternatively, since cytokinesis can be disrupted by osmotic pressure [10], and vha-19(RNAi) embryos are osmotically fragile, this may explain why some vha-19(RNAi) embryos appear to have a defect in cytokinesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33200</offset><text>We attempted to film vha-19(RNAi) embryos to ascertain precisely when in cytokinesis defects might occur, but could not detect actively dividing nuclei. In a few rare instances we observed pronuclei in vha-19(RNAi) embryos fusing and attempting to divide, but the cleavage furrow regressed and the nuclei collapsed together, which supports the hypothesis that VHA-19 may be involved in a critical secretion step in cytokinesis. Since most vha-19(RNAi) embryos had multiple nuclei (Figs 4A-B,E-F), this implies that nuclear division was not prevented. While it has been shown that providing osmotic support for embryos can rescue their cytokinesis defects [10], we could not rescue cell division using 150 mM KCl (a medium used for osmotic support of fragile embryos [28]) or Egg Buffer [45]. An intact eggshell is required for extrusion of the polar body and partitioning of P granules [10], [28], but we observed polar bodies in at least a few vha-19(RNAi) embryos (Figure 4E). Thus, while vha-19(RNAi) embryos are osmotically sensitive and clearly have defects in osmoregulation (Figure 4B-C), it is not clear whether the failure of cytokinesis in these embryos is an indirect result of osmotic sensitivity or because VHA-19 has a separate role in cytokinesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34463</offset><text>It is also possible that VHA-19 may have a role in cytokinesis in the oocytes, because endomitotic oocytes were observed in the oviducts of vha-19(RNAi) adults (Figure 2C-D), and vha-19(RNAi) adults produced fewer oocytes overall (Figure 2B). Interestingly, these phenotypes were also observed when expression of known subunits of the V-ATPase were silenced [41], although the onset of the phenotypes was earlier and more severe when individual V-ATPase genes were silenced. Efficient germline proliferation requires functioning cytokinesis [46], and expression of vha-19 mRNA has been detected in the germline precursor cell [40], suggesting that VHA-19 may have a role in germline proliferation. Loss of function of cytokinesis genes also induces multinucleate oocytes [46], which were observed in the oviducts of 20% of vha-19(RNAi) adults (not shown), but this was not significantly different from control(RNAi) adults (10/46 vs. 2/34). If there was a defect in cytokinesis in vha-19(RNAi) oocytes, this could also be an indirect consequence of oocyte osmotic fragility.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35538</offset><text>In summary, we propose that VHA-19 is involved in trafficking of molecules in the oocytes and the embryo that are essential for osmotic homeostasis, and possibly, cytokinesis.

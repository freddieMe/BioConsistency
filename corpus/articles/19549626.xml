Here, this transporter in maize (ZmYS1) and barley (HvYS1) was further characterized and compared in terms of expression pattern, diurnal change, and tissue-type specificity of localization. The expression of HvYS1 was specifically induced by Fe deficiency only in barley roots, and increased with the progress of Fe deficiency, whereas ZmYS1 was expressed in maize in the leaf blades and sheaths, crown, and seminal roots, but not in the hypocotyl. HvYS1 expression was not induced by any other metal deficiency. Furthermore, in maize leaf blades, the expression was higher in the young leaf blades showing severe chlorosis than in the old leaf blades showing no chlorosis. The expression of HvYS1 showed a distinct diurnal rhythm, reaching a maximum before the onset of phytosiderophore secretion. In contrast, ZmYS1 did not show such a rhythm in expression. Immunostaining showed that ZmYS1 was localized in the epidermal cells of both crown and lateral roots, with a polar localization at the distal side of the epidermal cells. In maize leaves, ZmYS1 was localized in mesophyll cells, but not epidermal cells. These differences in gene expression pattern and tissue-type specificity of localization suggest that HvYS1 is only involved in primary Fe acquisition by barley roots, whereas ZmYS1 is involved in both primary Fe acquisition and intracellular transport of iron and other metals in maize.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1692</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1705</offset><text>Some gramineous plants such as barley and wheat have a distinct strategy (Strategy II) for iron (Fe) acquisition, which is different from that of non-grass species (Marschner and Romheld, 1994; Curie and Briat, 2003; Walker and Connolly, 2008). Iron acquisition by gramineous plants includes (i) biosynthesis of phytosiderophores (mugineic acids) inside the roots; (ii) secretion of phytosiderophores to the rhizosphere; (iii) solubilization of insoluble iron in soils by chelation of phytosiderophores; and (iv) uptake of the ferric-phytosiderophore complex by the roots (Ma, 2005). It has been demonstrated that the last step is mediated through a transporter for the ferric-phytosiderophore complex. The first gene (YS1, Yellow Stripe 1) encoding the ferric-phytosiderophore transporter was identified in maize (Curie et al., 2001). YS1 belongs to the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family (Yen et al., 2001), but quite distantly as it shares only ~10% similarity and does not contain the OPT consensus domain (Koh et al., 2002). There are eight and 19 homologues (YSL, Yellow Stripe-like proteins) of YS1 in the Arabidopsis and rice genome, respectively (Curie et al., 2001, Jean et al., 2005). Some homologues have also been identified in barley (Murata et al., 2006) and in a dicot species, Thlaspi caerulescens (Gendre et al., 2007). The presence of YSL in non-grass species suggests that YSLs are involved not only in iron acquisition, but also in the internal transport of iron.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3193</offset><text>Previous studies suggest that there are at least two distinct groups of YSLs based on their expression patterns and transport substrates. One group transports the Fe(III)-phytosiderophore complex from the rhizosphere to the root cells, and includes ZmYS1, HvYS1 from barley, and OsYSL15 from rice (Curie et al., 2001; Murata et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2009). The other group is responsible for the intracellular transport of iron and other metals complexed with nicotianamine (NA), and includes OsYSL2, AtYSL1, 2, 3, and TcYSL3. In contrast to the known transporters for ferric-phytosiderophore in roots (e.g. ZmYS1, HvYS1, and OsYSL15), transporters such as OsYSL2 from rice and AtYSL2 from Arabidopsis did not transport the Fe(III)-phytosiderophore complex in yeast and/or Xenopus oocyte assay (DiDonato et al., 2004; Koike et al., 2004). Instead, OsYSL2 transports Fe(II)-NA and Mn-NA complexes (Koike et al., 2004), and AtYSL2 transports Fe(II)-NA and Cu-NA complexes in yeast (DiDonato et al., 2004), although contrasting results also have been reported (Schaaf et al., 2005). OsYSL2 is expressed in the companion cells of leaf blades and sheaths, and has been suggested to be involved in phloem transport of Fe and Mn, while AtYSL2 is expressed in many cell types in both roots and shoots and is suggested to be involved in the lateral movement of metals in the vasculature and in Fe and Zn homeostasis (DiDonato et al., 2004; Schaaf et al., 2005). The transport substrates for AtYSL1 and AtYSL3 have not been identified, but analysis with single and double mutants suggested that these genes are responsible for mobilization of micronutrients such as Mn, Zn, Cu, and Fe from leaves and for loading of Fe-NA into the seeds (Jean et al., 2005; Waters et al., 2006).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4965</offset><text>HvYS1 is the closest homologue of ZmYS1, sharing 72.7% identity and 95.0% similarity, but they have different expression patterns and transport substrates. HvYS1 is only expressed in the roots (Murata et al., 2006), whereas ZmYS1 is expressed in both roots and shoots (Curie et al., 2001). Both transporters are greatly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Furthermore, in contrast to HvYS1, which transports the ferric-phytosiderophore complex only (Murata et al., 2006), ZmYS1 also transports other substrates including zinc-, copper-, and nickel-phytosiderophore complexes, and nickel, Fe(II), and Fe(III) complexes with NA in yeast and Xenopus oocytes (Roberts et al., 2004; Schaaf et al., 2004). These results suggest that ZmYS1 and HvYS1 may have different roles in iron and metal transport. However, since HvYS1 and ZmYS1 were characterized by different groups previously, results may not be comparable. For example, the localization of HvYS1 activity has been examined, but that of ZmYS1 is unknown. In the present study, to make ZmYS1 and HvYS1 comparable, they were further characterized in terms of expression pattern and tissue localization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6113</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6135</offset><text>Plant materials and growth condition</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6172</offset><text>Seeds of barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv.

In the present study, the expression of HvYS1 was determined at different time points after iron deficiency by using real-time RT-PCR. Similar to ZmYS1 (Curie et al., 2001), the expression of HvYS1 increased with the time of Fe deficiency treatment (Fig. 1A).

Generally, plants start to secrete phytosiderophores in the morning from the third hour after sunrise or the onset of the light period, and secretion continues for ~3 h. However, gramineous plants such as maize do not show a diurnal rhythm in secretion (Yehuda et al., 1996). To investigate whether the expression of ZmYS1 and HvYS1 has a diurnal rhythm, the time-dependent expression of HvYS1 and ZmYS1 as well as phytosiderophore secretion were determined in Fe-deficient barley and maize. In Fe-deficient barley, the secretion of phytosiderophore showed a diurnal rhythm (P &lt;0.01; Fig. 5A). With sunrise occurring at 7:00 h, the secretion reached a peak during 9:00-to 12:00 h. This result is in agreement with previous findings (Takagi et al., 1984). In contrast to the phytosiderophore secretion pattern, HvYS1 was expressed all day in the Fe-deficient barley roots (Fig. 5B). However, there was a significant fluctuation in the expression level (P &lt;0.01). The peak of expression was found at 6:00 h, which was before sunrise (Fig. 5B), and remained at a constant level at 9:00 h, during the peak of phytosiderophore secretion. This result is not completely consistent with that of Nagasaka et al. (2009). They found that the expression peak of HvYS1 was at the start of illumination. Since they did not monitor the secretion of phytosiderophore at the same time, it is difficult to compare their results directly with the present results. Phytosiderophore is easily degraded by microorganisms (Watanabe and Wada, 1989); therefore, the expression of HvYS1 before the secretion of phytosiderophore will help the roots to take up the Fe(III)-phytosiderophore complex efficiently.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>19166</offset><text>Diurnal rhythm of phytosiderophore secretion (A) and HvYS1 expression (B) in barley.

However, in maize, the tissue-type specificity of localization of ZmYS1 is unknown. The localization was investigated by immunostaining with anti-ZmYS1 polyclonal antibody. In the Fe-sufficient maize, the signal of ZmYS1 was hardly observed in both the crown and lateral roots (Fig. 7A, D). However, in the Fe-deficient maize, ZmYS1 was found to be localized at the epidermal cells of crown and lateral roots (Fig. 7B. E). This localization is similar to HvYS1 (Murata et al., 2006). However, different from HvYS1, ZmYS1 showed polar localization at the distal side of the epidermal cells. Polar localization of some mineral transporters has been reported recently. For example, an influx silicon transporter Lsi1 is localized at the distal side of the exodermal and endodermal cells of rice roots (Ma et al., 2006), while an efflux silicon transporter Lsi2 is localized at the proximal side of the same cells (Ma et al., 2007). In maize roots, the Si influx transporter ZmLsi1 also showed polar localization at the distal side of epidermal and cortical cells (Mitani et al., 2009). To our knowledge, this is the first time that polar localization has been described for a metal complex transporter. The mechanism controlling polar localization of transporters has not been described. It will be interesting to elucidate the mechanism of polar localization by comparing HvYS1 and ZmYS1 in the future.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>22301</offset><text>Tissue-specific localization of ZmYS1 in maize roots.

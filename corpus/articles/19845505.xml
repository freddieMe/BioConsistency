N-terminal fragments of IP3R1 (type 1 IP3R) were tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, expressed in COS-7 cells and their distribution was determined by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Localization of IP3R1 in the ER requires translation of between 26 and 34 residues beyond the end of the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), a region that includes TMD2 (second transmembrane domain). Replacement of these post-TMD1 residues with unrelated sequences of similar length (24-36 residues) partially mimicked the native residues. We conclude that for IP3R approx. 30 residues after TMD1 must be translated to allow a signal sequence within TMD1 to be extruded from the ribosome and mediate co-translational targeting to the ER. Hydrophobic residues within TMD1 and TMD2 then ensure stable association with the ER membrane.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1200</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1213</offset><text>IP3R [IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptors] are the intracellular Ca2+ channels that both initiate and regeneratively propagate the cytosolic Ca2+ signals evoked by the many receptors that stimulate IP3 formation [1]. All IP3R are tetramers, each with an IP3-binding site lying close to the N-terminus and six TMD (transmembrane domains) lying close to the C-terminus (Figure 1A). The last pair of TMD from each subunit together with their intervening luminal loop form the pore [2,3]. In most animal cells, IP3R are expressed mainly within the membranes of the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), but they are also expressed within the nuclear envelope [4], nucleoplasmic reticulum [5], Golgi apparatus [6], plasma membrane [7], and perhaps also in secretory vesicles [8], although the latter is contentious [9]. Within these membranes, IP3R are not uniformly distributed and different subtypes may differ in their distributions [10,11]. The subcellular distribution of IP3R accounts for their ability to generate cytosolic Ca2+ signals that are spatially organized, thereby allowing Ca2+ to regulate specifically a diverse array of cellular processes [1]. The versatility of Ca2+ as a ubiquitous intracellular messenger thus depends upon precise targeting of IP3R to specific subcellular compartments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>2517</offset><text>Fusion proteins used</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>2538</offset><text>(A) Key regions of IP3R1.

Targeting of proteins to the ER is mediated by a short stretch of amino acid residues, the signal sequence, which may be either an N-terminal sequence that is later cleaved, or an internal non-cleavable sequence [12]. The latter, signal-anchor sequences, serve the dual purpose of directing the protein to the ER and anchoring it within the membrane. Signal sequences vary widely in primary sequence, but in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes they share a hydrophobic core of 8-12 residues for cleavable signals and of 20-30 residues for internal signals [13]. The diversity of signal sequences allows them to function with different efficiencies and also provides a mechanism that allows proteins that might become terminally misfolded to be directed away from the ER for degradation during ER stress [14].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3950</offset><text>The signal sequence, whether N-terminal or internal, is recognized by the SRP (signal recognition particle). For most eukaryotic secretory or membrane proteins, this occurs co-translationally [15], but a minority of proteins (those with a C-terminal signal sequence) are post-translationally targeted [16]. Co-translational targeting is initiated when SRP binds simultaneously to the exposed signal sequence and the ribosome, forming the SRP-ribosome nascent chain complex [15]. SRP may also recognize a conformation of the ribosome within which a signal-anchor sequence is still concealed and so pre-associate with the ribosome before binding tightly to the emerging signal sequence [17]. The SRP-ribosome nascent chain complex then binds to the SRP receptor within the ER membrane [18], SRP dissociates, protein synthesis resumes and the growing protein is directed into the ER through the open translocon. The latter is a channel formed largely from the Sec61 complex that allows proteins to pass into either the lumen of the ER or laterally into the ER membrane [19,20].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5025</offset><text>After incorporation into the ER membrane, proteins may either remain there or move on. Proteins remain because they express signals that prevent them from leaving the ER or promote their retrieval from the Golgi apparatus. Luminal ER proteins are retrieved by a C-terminal KDEL motif, whereas integral membrane proteins are retrieved from post-ER compartments by cytosolic motifs such as the C-terminal di-lysine or N-terminal di-arginine motif [21,22]. TMD can also mediate ER retention [23-25]. None of the cytosolic motifs known to mediate ER retrieval are present in IP3R, but our earlier work demonstrated that any pair of TMD with a linking luminal loop can retain an IP3R fragment or a plasma membrane protein within the ER [26].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5762</offset><text>IP3R lack an N-terminal signal sequence, but, as with other ER membrane proteins, hydrophobic residues within the TMD can provide internal signal sequences. RyR1 (type 1 ryanodine receptor), for example, is targeted to the ER by its first TMD [27], and a sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) is targeted and retrieved by its first pair of TMD [28]. For IP3R1, the TMD region is sufficient for ER targeting [29,30], with later work suggesting that the first pair of TMD is essential [3,26]. Our analysis of fragments comprising individual TMD or pairs of TMD demonstrated that any pair of TMD linked by their luminal loops is sufficient to localize IP3R1 to the ER [26]. These results, derived from short fragments of IP3R1 lacking the N-terminus, suggest that IP3R1 is targeted to the ER only after translation of the first and second TMD and the following loops. This highlights residues lying between the beginning of TMD1 and the end of the cytosolic loop following TMD2 (Figure 1B) as the most likely determinants of IP3R1 targeting to the ER. However, the relative roles of residues within this region when IP3R1 has its normal large cytosolic N-terminus are not clear. In the present study, we address this issue by systematically examining the subcellular distribution of IP3R1 fragments progressively truncated from the C-terminus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7115</offset><text>EXPERIMENTAL</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7128</offset><text>Expression constructs</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7150</offset><text>All constructs are based on the full-length rat IP3R1 [31] (GenBank  accession number GQ233032) lacking the S1 splice region [32].

To identify calreticulin, an ER luminal protein, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-calreticulin antibody [Calbiochem; 1:100 dilution in PBS with 5% (w/v) BSA] for 2.5 h at 20  C and then for 12 h at 4  C. We and others [33] also find calreticulin in the nucleoplasm of some cells. There was no consistent relationship between this nucleoplasmic expression of calreticulin and either the fixation method or the transfected construct. The benefits of using an antibody to an endogenous protein to identify the ER outweigh the drawbacks of it occasionally also staining the nucleoplasm. Cells were washed (3x5 min) with PBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor  633 secondary antibody [Molecular Probes; 1:500 dilution in PBS with 5% (w/v) BSA] for 1 h at 20  C. Cells were washed (3x5 min) with PBS and once with water, and the coverslips were mounted in Prolong anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes).

The ER extends to the periphery without clear boundaries, while the cytosol clearly defines the cell boundary.

Briefly, three lines were drawn across each cell to exclude the nucleus, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was computed for the relationship between the intensities of the two fluorescence channels (green for IP3R fragments and red for calreticulin).

It exhibited strong perinuclear fluorescence that extended towards the periphery of the cell in a tubular network and it co-localized with calreticulin, an ER luminal protein (Figure 2A, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). After subcellular fractionation, FL was found mostly (88+-4%) in the P fraction (integral membrane proteins; see the Experimental section). EYFP (results not shown) or EGFP alone was diffusely spread throughout the cell, including the nucleus, and did not co-localize with calreticulin (Figure 2B). EGFP was found largely (77+-5%) in the S1 fraction (cytosolic proteins; Figure 2B). An EYFP-tagged fragment of IP3R1 (TMD1-2) that includes only the last 58 residues of the N-terminal cytosolic region and extends to the end of the cytosolic loop following TMD2 had a distribution similar to that of FL and it co-localized with calreticulin (Table 1). TMD1-2 was present largely (84+-5%) in the P fraction (Figure 2C). A similar, but shorter, IP3R1 fragment (TMD1) truncated after eight of the 12 residues linking TMD1 to TMD2 did not co-localize with calreticulin (Figure 2D), but instead co-localized with MitoTracker Red (Figure 2E) [26]. As expected [26], there was no such co-localization of TMD1-2 with mitochondria (Supplementary Figure S5 available at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250061add.htm). TMD1 was also found largely in the P fraction (82+-6%). The presence of TMD1 in the P fraction highlights the limitations of using simple fractionation methods alone to resolve the targeting of IP3R fragments to the ER. A fragment (TMD2) comprising only the last eight residues of the loop linking TMD1 to TMD2 and terminating 12 residues after the end of TMD2 was also expressed in mitochondria, but not in the ER (results not shown) [26].

To identify the first ER-targeting signal in native IP3R1, we examined the distribution of fragments of IP3R1 truncated only at the C-terminus (Figure 1C).

These results define the minimal number of residues beyond TMD1 that must be translated to allow effective localization of IP3R1 in the ER: 12 residues are not sufficient (Figure 3C), 26 residues are partially effective (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S6) and 34 residues after TMD1 allow the protein (Figure 4C) to be targeted to the ER as effectively as FL (Figure 2A and Table 1). We conclude that between 26 and 34 residues beyond the end of TMD1 must be translated for native IP3R1 to be effectively localized in the ER (Figure 5A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>25352</offset><text>Non-native sequences after TMD1 facilitate ER localization</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>25411</offset><text>(A) Summary of the present results and those from previous analyses of expression in COS-1 cells [3] (open triangles) or in vitro [35] (filled triangle). The native IP3R sequence is shown in red (TMD1), black (TMD2), white (non-TMD) or hatched (N-terminal domain); EGFP/EYFP tags are shown in green, and C-terminal tags or non-native sequence in grey. All sequences from TMD1 towards the C-terminal (including C-terminal tags) are drawn to scale (see scale bar). The boxed area shows the ~40 residues concealed within the ribosome tunnel. As more of TMD2 and the following loop are translated, the putative signal sequence in TMD1 emerges from the ribosome, allowing it to bind SRP. (B, C) Cells transiently transfected with the indicated constructs are shown in the same format as in Figure 2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26206</offset><text>Another analysis of similar IP3R1 fragments truncated at the C-terminus but with a C-terminal tag (11 residues) demonstrated that, when these were expressed in COS-1 cells, a fragment truncated six residues after TMD1 (NT[6+11]) was equally distributed between cytosolic and membrane fractions, whereas all constructs longer than NT[35+11] were entirely in the membrane fraction (Figure 5A) [3]. Using an in vitro translation system, a construct that included 21 residues before TMD1, nine native residues after it and a C-terminal tag of 42 residues (NT[9+42]) was effectively co-translationally inserted into microsomal membranes [35]. NT[9+42] and NT[35+11] have similar numbers of residues after TMD1 (51 and 46 respectively). Although the results from these analyses in vitro (suggesting a requirement for only TMD1) [35] and cells (suggesting a requirement for TMD1 and TMD2) [3] were thought to be contradictory, they are each consistent with a need for &lt;=51 residues after TMD1 to be translated to allow ER localization of IP3R1. We can now refine that requirement and conclude that between 26 and 34 residues beyond the end of TMD1 must be translated for IP3R1 to be targeted to the ER.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>27402</offset><text>Residues after TMD1 mediate both exposure of the signal sequence and membrane-anchoring of IP3R</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27498</offset><text>Signal sequences bind to SRP only after about ten residues have emerged from the ribosomal tunnel [36], which is ~10 nm long and can accommodate 30-40 unfolded residues [37]. The requirement for translation of 26-34 residues after TMD1, which includes TMD2 and some of the following loop (Figures 1B and 1C), may therefore reflect a need for these specific residues to contribute to ER targeting or they may be required only to allow exposure of a signal sequence in TMD1 (Figure 5A). The latter would be consistent with the analysis in vitro showing that TMD1 with the following loop mediates co-translational targeting when it is followed by a sequence of 42 residues unrelated to the IP3R [35].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28196</offset><text>If the post-TMD1 residues serve only to expel the signal sequence from the ribosome tunnel, any sequence of 30-40 residues after the signal sequence within TMD1 would be sufficient to allow ER targeting. We therefore expressed IP3R1 with the loop following TMD1 duplicated to provide 24 residues beyond the end of TMD1 (NT[2x12]) or with three repeats to provide 36 residues (NT[3x12]) (Figure 1C). These proteins are similar in length to the shortest fragments that were partially (NT[26]; Figure 4B) or completely (NT[34]; Figure 4C) localized in the ER. Both NT[2x12] and NT[3x12] were found largely in the P fraction (63+-4% and 58+-5% respectively). Their integration into membranes is therefore much greater than for NT[12] (17+-1%), but clearly less than for NT[26] (84+-3%) and NT[34] (81+-4%). These results suggest that a major role of the post-TMD1 residues is to allow a hydrophobic signal sequence within TMD1 to be pushed out of the ribosome tunnel and allow its recognition by SRP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29193</offset><text>However, the replicated (hydrophilic) residues from the post-TMD1 loop were not as effective as the native (hydrophobic) residues of TMD2 in causing IP3R1 fragments to associate with the P fraction (~60% compared with ~80%), and nor were the fragments with replicated loops clearly co-localized with the ER in confocal images (Figures 5B and 5C, and Table 1). We suggest that, in addition to providing residues that allow the signal sequence to be extruded from the ribosome, hydrophobic residues within TMD2 also contribute to anchoring the large IP3R fragments in the ER membrane.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>29776</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29788</offset><text>Co-translational targeting of IP3R to the ER [35] is the first step in the sequence of events that leads to IP3R being precisely located within intracellular membranes and thereby placed to generate spatially organized Ca2+ signals [1]. The large N-terminal cytosolic region of the IP3R (2272 residues) is translated and folds to include a functional IP3-binding site before the protein is directed to the ER. This ensures the final cytosolic disposition of this region and dictates the transmembrane topology of the complete IP3R. Evidence derived from expression in vitro and in cells of IP3R fragments with and without the complete N-terminus indicates that the sequence that includes TMD1 and TMD2 is sufficient for ER targeting [3,26,35] (Figure 2). Effective targeting occurs after translation of between 26 and 34 residues beyond the end of TMD1, a region that includes TMD2 (Figure 5A). Replacement of this post-TMD1 region with a similar number of hydrophilic residues can partially substitute for the native residues in mediating ER targeting (Figures 5B and 5C), suggesting that a major role is to facilitate extrusion from the ribosome of a signal recognition sequence within TMD1 allowing its recognition by SRP. Once targeted to the ER, the TMD provide the hydrophobic anchors that retain IP3R within the ER, with TMD1 and TMD2 together sufficient to ensure complete retention within the ER [26].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31199</offset><text>Online data</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31211</offset><text>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31231</offset><text>Evangelia Pantazaka completed the experiments.

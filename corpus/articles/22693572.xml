To date, the molecular mechanisms of sulfite metabolism in plants are largely unknown. Previously, a full-length cDNA of the putative sulfite oxidase gene from maize (ZmSO) was cloned, and its response to SO2/sulfite stress at the transcriptional level was characterized. In this study, the recombinant ZmSO protein was purified from E.coli. It exhibited sulfite-dependent activity and had strong affinity for the substrate sulfite. Over-expression (OE) of ZmSO in tobacco plants enhanced their tolerance to sulfite stress. The plants showed much less damage, less sulfite accumulation, but greater amounts of sulfate. This suggests that tolerance of transgenic plants to sulfite was enhanced by increasing SO expression levels. Interestingly, H2O2 accumulation levels by histochemical detection and quantitative determination in the OE plants were much less than those in the wild-type upon sulfite stress. Furthermore, reductions of catalase levels detected in the OE lines were considerably less than in the wild-type plants. This indicates that SO may play an important role in protecting CAT from inhibition by excess sulfite. Collectively, these data demonstrate that transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing ZmSO enhance tolerance to excess sulfite through sulfite oxidation and catalase-mediated hydrogen peroxide scavenging. This is the first SO gene from monocots to be functionally characterized.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1627</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1640</offset><text>As a molybdenum-containing enzyme, sulfite oxidase (SO; EC 1.8.3.1) catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, and thus plays important roles in diverse metabolic processes such as sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism [1], [2], [3].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1884</offset><text>SO has been identified from prokaryotes such as Thiobacillus thioparus [4], Thiobacillus novellus [5], [6], and Thiobacillus acidophilus [7], and from eukaryotes such as humans [8], [9], chicken [10], mouse [11], and Arabidopsis thaliana [12]. The well-known vertebrate SO is a homodimer and is localized within the mitochondria [8]. It contains three functional domains: an N-terminal heme domain, a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain [13]. Several animal sulfite oxidases have been crystallized and their catalytic mechanisms have been unraveled [1], [13], [14]. Deficiency of the enzyme in humans leads to severe neurological abnormalities and early death [15].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2586</offset><text>In higher plants, A. thaliana SO (AtSO) was the first identified and biochemically characterized sulfite oxidase [12], [16], [17], [18]. Compared with animal SO, AtSO lacks the heme domain and possesses a molybdenum center alone and thus is the simplest Mo-enzyme [12], [16]. AtSO shows sulfite-dependent oxidizing activity with ferricyanide as an artificial electron acceptor [12]. Recent biochemical evidence has revealed that AtSO utilizes molecular oxygen as a natural electron acceptor, ultimately resulting in the formation of hydrogen peroxide [17], [18]. Studies on the physiological roles of plant SO have been lagging behind biochemical studies. Most reports have been made in recent years. The SO proteins from A. thaliana and N. benthamiana have been confirmed to be involved in sulfite/sulfur dioxide detoxification in planta by genetic approaches [19], [20], [21]. AtSO is localized in peroxisomes, but it co-regulates the sulfate assimilation pathway with the chloroplast-localized enzyme adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) [22], [23].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3646</offset><text>In spite of the progress made in understanding molecular and biological function of SO in model plants, the knowledge of molecular and functional aspects of the SO proteins from higher plants is still limited. Maize (Zea mays) is an important cereal crop worldwide that is a staple food to many populations. Environmental pollutants such as sulfur dioxide/sulfite and acid rain adversely affect maize growth and development by inducing occurrence of physiological diseases, thus they are becoming serious problems in several maize-planting regions of Northern China [24].Unfortunately, molecular mechanisms underlying sulfite metabolism in plants are largely unknown, let alone in crop plants. In our recent work, a putative sulfite oxidase gene from maize (ZmSO) was cloned by RACE-PCR, and its response to SO2 stress was characterized [25]. However, the biochemical properties and physiological functions of the putative crop SO during sulfite stress are still unclear. Here we characterized the putative maize SO homolog in transgenic tobacco to investigate sulfite stress tolerance and possible detoxification mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4772</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4780</offset><text>Sulfite Oxidase Activity of ZmSO in vitro</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4822</offset><text>In our recent study, the full-length cDNA of ZmSO (accession number: FJ436404) was obtained by 5'- and 3'-RACE- PCR.

This may be indicative of H2O2 accumulation during SO-dependent sulfite detoxification in wild-type and OE plants. Histochemical detection of H2O2 accumulation was performed with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining in sulfite-treated and control leaf discs from wild-type and OE plants. No significant differences in DAB staining intensity were observed between wild-type and OE lines after 16 h of distilled water-treated controls. When the discs were treated with sulfite, a significant increase was observed in DAB staining intensity (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, the wild-type showed much higher DAB staining intensity than the OE lines (Fig. 4A). Quantitative determination of H2O2 accumulation further demonstrated that the wild-type increased by 3.6-fold in DAB staining intensity, while the OE lines only increased by less than 1-fold (90% for OE-3 and 26% for OE-7; Fig. 4B). These results further demonstrate that sulfite can induce ROS production, thus leads to oxidative stress. However, H2O2 accumulation in ZmSO transgenic lines is much less than in wild-type plants; indicating that ZmSO OE lines may have more efficient H2O2 scavenging than wild-type plants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>13679</offset><text>H2O2 accumulation in leaf discs of wild-type and ZmSO over-expressing plants in response to sulfite exposure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13789</offset><text>(A) H2O2 production in leaf discs of wild-type and OE plants treated with 5 mM Na2SO3 was visualized by staining with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB).

To check this hypothesis, CAT activities were examined in intact leaves from wild-type and OE lines during sulfite stress. After 16 h of 5 mM sulfite exposure, the wild-type displayed a 65% reduction in CAT activity whereas the two OE lines only showed reductions of 38% and 16% in CAT activity, respectively (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrated that CAT activities in the OE lines are reduced much less than in the wild-type. This indicates that higher levels of SO may play a role in protecting CAT from inhibition by excess sulfite. In return, high residual CAT activity can scavenge H2O2 accumulation efficiently in OE transgenic lines. As a result, high levels of SO and CAT contribute to less leaf damage in the OE lines during sulfite stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>15312</offset><text>Effects of sulfite on catalase activity and gene expression in wild-type and ZmSO over-expression tobacco plants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15426</offset><text>(A) Effect of sulfite on total catalase (CAT) activity in wild-type and OE lines (OE-3 and OE-7).

After 16 h, the abundance of Cat1 and Cat2 transcripts displayed differential patterns between the wild-type and OE lines. Compared with controls, the transcript levels of Cat1 were sharply down-regulated in the wild-type, whereas they were partially reduced in the OE lines.

The OE-3 line showed small down-regulation of Cat2 (20% reduction), but Cat2 was still significantly down-regulated in the wild-type (50% reduction, Fig. 5C).

No activity was found with cytochrome c as the electron acceptor (data not shown). Since the heme domain is missing within the protein, this may indicate that the natural electron acceptor in vivo is oxygen. This observation was also found in the SO from the model plant Arabidopsis and the bacterial D. radiodurans due to the absence of heme binding domains in the proteins [12], [27]. The Km for sulfite in the ferricyanide assay was determined to be 21.4 microM, which is much lower than the Km values for Arabidopsis (33.8 microM) [12], rat (33.0 microM) [14], or Nicotiana tabacum SO (51.4 microM), but in the same range of the values for human [28] and chicken [13] SO (17 and 19.1 microM, respectively). This suggests that ZmSO has higher affinity towards sulfite than Arabidopsis and tobacco SO proteins, whereas slightly lower affinity than those of human and chicken. The crystal structure of Arabidopsis SO has revealed that Arg374 is an important conserved residue for sulfite-binding [16]. Further studies will be interesting to identify the active site responsible for substrate binding and catalytic activity in the monocot ZmSO by site-directed mutagenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>19014</offset><text>SO Protects Plants Against Sulfite Toxicity Predominantly via Sulfite Oxidation</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19094</offset><text>Under normal conditions, the OE transgenic lines displayed no obvious phenotypic differences in appearance, flowering, and seed production compared with the wild-type plants when grown in soil (data not shown).

Sulfite and sulfate content determination revealed that smaller increases in the total sulfite and greater increases in sulfate were observed in both OE lines compared to wild-type plants regardless of 5 or 10 mM sulfite exposure (Fig. 3B,C). In other words, greater amounts of sulfite were transformed to nontoxic sulfate in the OE lines due to the increased SO activity levels.

This reinforces the view that SO-dependent sulfite oxidation is still the predominant pathway during sulfite detoxification in plants. Further work is needed to dissect the SO-dependent sulfite detoxification network using microarray analysis in SO-modified plants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20671</offset><text>SO may Play a Positive Role in Protecting CAT from Inhibition by Excess Sulfite</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20751</offset><text>The recombinant Arabidopsis SO has been identified to be a novel producer of H2O2 as observed by in vitro biochemical assays [17].

Theoretically, greater amounts of H2O2 should be produced in the OE lines than in the wild-type during sulfite detoxification, but much less H2O2 accumulation was observed in the OE lines (Fig. 4). CAT is essential for the removal of H2O2 produced in the peroxisomes [29]. The activity levels of CAT in both wild-type and OE lines were down-regulated by sulfite stress, but much less reductions of CAT levels were detected in the OE lines than in the wild-type plants (Fig. 5).

Excised shoots were then transferred to the hormone-free MS medium supplemented with 50 mg l-1 kanamycin for root induction [33]. These kanamycin-resistant plantlets were confirmed by PCR with primers SO-F3:5'-TGCCCGGGCTCACGGCAC-3' and SO-R3:5'- CAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGC-3' (the reverse primer SO-R3 only contains coding sequence of the 6xhistidine peptide tag) for ZmSO transgenic tobacco. The PCR-positive plantlets were transplanted into soil for growing in the growth room. The transgenic tobacco progenies were selected using 1/2 MS plate containing 50 mg l-1 kanamycin and maintained growth to set seeds in soil until T2 generation. Six independent homozygous ZmSO over-expression (OE) transgenic lines (named OE-1, OE-3, OE-4, OE-7, OE-9, and OE-10) were developed. The expression of the transgene in the six lines was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with SO-F3 and SO-R3.The cDNA contents of different reverse transcription reactions were normalized by amplifying Actin transcripts using a pair of primers Actin-F:  and Actin-R: 5'-AACAGGGAGAAGATGACCC A-3', which produces an 874-bp product. Based on the results of the semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments, two representative OE lines (OE-3 and OE-7) were selected for further use. The expression levels of ZmSO protein in the two lines were investigated using Western blot analysis with the anti-histidine monoclonal antibody.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>27016</offset><text>Treatment of Sulfite for Tobacco Leaf Discs</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27060</offset><text>The fifth fully expanded leaves from 8-week-old wild-type and transgenic plants were used for sulfite stress assay.

Crude proteins were extracted and used for the determination of catalase (CAT) activity [36]. CAT gene expression in sulfite-treated tobacco plants was conducted by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene sequences from tobacco were obtained as described by Pasqualini et al. [37]. Gene-specific primers for tobacco are: NtActin Act-F:  and Act-R: ; NtCat1 Cat1-F:  and Cat1-R: ; NtCat2 Cat2-F:  and Cat2-R: . Criteria for designing primers were a primer size between 20 and 25, an optimal Tm at 60  C, and a product size ranging from 180 bp to 250 bp. Amplification of Actin (accession numbers: AF15640) was used as internal control for tobacco and qRT-PCR assays were performed on an IQ5 light cycler (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Premix ExTaq II (Takara, Japan) with gene-specific primers above. For the entire qRT-PCR assay, three technical replicates were performed for each experiment and the expression of each gene was investigated in three biological replicates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>29290</offset><text>Western Blot Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29312</offset><text>Twenty micrograms of protein were electrophoretically separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

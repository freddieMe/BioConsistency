18251717_2|18251717|21620|#section_info|0:848|Uncoupling through the ANT is inhibited by carboxyatractylate [13], whereas uncoupling through UCPs is classically inhibited by GDP [14,45]. Proton-leak kinetics were measured after energization with succinate for 2.5 min in the absence and presence of carboxyatractylate and GDP to determine whether ANT and UCP3 were involved (Figure 4A). Figure 4(B) shows that at the highest common membrane potential, 180 mV, GDP and carboxyatractylate significantly inhibited proton conductance separately and in combination. The extent of the carboxyatractylate inhibition of proton conductance suggests that the majority is attributable to ANT. As observed previously [15], inhibition of proton conductance by GDP and carboxyatractylate was non-additive; characterization of the relative contributions of ANT and UCP3 therefore required further experiments.|#main_body|GO:2000277|positive regulation of oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler activity|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler activity.|IMP|GOA|Slc25a4(85333)|#gene_synonym

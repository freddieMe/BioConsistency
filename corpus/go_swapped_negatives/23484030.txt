23484030_25|23484030|20409|#section_info|0:0|The homozygous gei-8(ok1671) animals had obvious phenotypes, including a progressive defect in locomotion starting at the L2 stage that was marked by a delayed response to prodding and a low pharyngeal pumping rate (Figure 5). Compared to wild-type animals of the same age, mutants were also characterized by a shorter maximum body length (750.25 microm, n = 6, SD = 50.59 microm), a convoluted intestine, gonadogenesis defects including loss of the spermathecae, sterility, and arrest at the L4 stage of development (Figure 6 C and D).|#main_body|GO:0040015|negative regulation of multicellular organism growth|Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of growth of an organism to reach its usual body size.|IMP|GOA|gei-8(176145)|#gene_synonym

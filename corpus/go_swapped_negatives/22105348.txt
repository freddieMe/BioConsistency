22105348_24|22105348|15143|#section_info|0:0|To investigate the cause of MyoV loss observed in crb mutant photoreceptors, we aimed to prevent the loss of MyoV by overexpression of a dominant-negative proteasome subunit Pros2612B (Belote and Fortier, 2002). This resulted in a marked increase in MyoV staining (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 2 D). Quantification of MyoV fluorescence (normalized to WT MyoV fluorescence per ommatidium, as described in Materials and methods) showed that the reduction of MyoV seen in crb mutant photoreceptors is rescued to ~80% of that seen in WT ommatidia upon proteasome inhibition in comparison with ~50% in the absence of proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 2 E). These data suggest that crb stabilizes MyoV protein by protecting it from degradation by the proteasome.|#main_body|GO:0032436|positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the breakdown of a protein or peptide by hydrolysis of its peptide bonds, initiated by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, and mediated by the proteasome.|IGI|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym
22105348_53|22105348|34665|#section_info|0:0|We investigated this further by inhibiting proteasomal degradation and observed a marked increase of MyoV staining in crb mutant photoreceptors compared with controls. These findings support our previous conclusion that the interaction between Crb and MyoV is stabilizing the latter by protecting it from degradation by the proteasome.|#main_body|GO:1901800|positive regulation of proteasomal protein catabolic process|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of proteasomal protein catabolic process.|IMP|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym

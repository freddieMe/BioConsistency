22879948_6|22879948|22629|#section_info|0:0|In the case of Mad, an overexpression with A9-Gal4 leads to a dramatic reduction in wing size, ectopic vein tissue and blistering (Fig. 4C). Coexpression of Fuss restores not only the size of the wing, but leads also to a notable amelioration of the vein-, respectively intervein patterning (Fig. 4D).|#main_body|GO:0030513|positive regulation of BMP signaling pathway|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of BMP signaling pathway activity.|IMP|GOA|fuss(192347)|#gene_synonym
22879948_7|22879948|22629|#section_info|0:0|Similar to Mad, Fuss is able to restore wing shape and vein patterning of Med overexpression to an almost wild type mode, with only slight failure of complete outgrowth of L5 and p-cv, reminescent of the fussC phenotype (Fig. 4E, F).|#main_body|GO:0030513|positive regulation of BMP signaling pathway|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of BMP signaling pathway activity.|IMP|GOA|fuss(192347)|#gene_synonym
22879948_8|22879948|26489|#section_info|0:0|Taken together, our results indicate that fuss exhibits its function as a negative regulator of the BMP cascade, most likely through interaction with the activating Co-Smad Medea.|#main_body|GO:0030513|positive regulation of BMP signaling pathway|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of BMP signaling pathway activity.|NONE|GOA|fuss(192347)|#gene_synonym

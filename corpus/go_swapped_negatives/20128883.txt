Hormone sensitivity tests, quantification of endogenous BR levels, expression analysis of marker genes and protein kinase assays indicate that ASKtheta acts as a novel negative regulator in BR signalling.|#main_body|GO:1900459|positive regulation of brassinosteroid mediated signaling pathway|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of brassinosteroid mediated signaling pathway.|IMP|GOA|ASKth(828023)|#gene_synonym

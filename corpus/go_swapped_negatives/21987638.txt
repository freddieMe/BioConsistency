21987638_27|21987638|9400|#section_info|933:1165|(E) A kinase-dead mutation in Plk4 inhibits its degradation in S2 cells. Anti-GFP immunoblot of S2 cell lysates shows that full-length kinase-dead Plk4-GFP is more stable than wt-Plk4-GFP, which is degraded and nearly undetectable. |#fig_caption|GO:0042177|negative regulation of protein catabolic process|Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of a protein by the destruction of the native, active configuration, with or without the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.|IMP|GOA|Plk4(40384)|#gene_synonym

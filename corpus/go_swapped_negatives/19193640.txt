There is an increase in phosphorylation of Src on  phospho-Tyr416 and of paxillin on phospho-Tyr118, but  phosphorylation on FAK at phospho-Tyr576 is impaired. |#fig_caption|GO:0001933|negative regulation of protein phosphorylation|Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the rate of addition of phosphate groups to amino acids within a protein.|IMP|GOA|Anxa2(56611)|#gene_synonym

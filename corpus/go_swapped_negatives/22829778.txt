YbeB of six different species binds to ribosomal protein L14. This interaction blocks the association of the two ribosomal subunits and, as a consequence, translation.|#main_body|GO:0045727|positive regulation of translation|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of proteins by the translation of mRNA or circRNA.|IDA|GOA|ybeB(12932664)|#gene_synonym

12707312_143|12707312|18002|#section_info|109:432|AIR-2 is not active above background levels, using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate, when expressed alone in insect cells. Mixing of AIR-2-containing lysates with CSC-1, BIR-1, or both did not activate AIR-2 kinase. However, AIR-2 was significantly activated upon mixing with an ICP-1-containing lysate (Fig. 5 B).|#main_body|GO:0006469|negative regulation of protein kinase activity|Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of protein kinase activity.|IDA|GOA|icp-1(171788)|#gene_synonym

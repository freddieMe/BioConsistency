We also demonstrated that this change significantly repressed the transcriptional activity of ZmO2 on the 22-kD zein promoter.|#main_body|GO:0061586|positive regulation of transcription by transcription factor localization|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of DNA-dependent transcription using a mechanism that involves the localization of a transcription factor.|EXP|GOA|Taxlin(100194064)|#gene_synonym

These results indicate that ZmTaxilin negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of ZmO2 when the two genes are co-expressed in onion cells.|#main_body|GO:0061586|positive regulation of transcription by transcription factor localization|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of DNA-dependent transcription using a mechanism that involves the localization of a transcription factor.|IDA|GOA|Taxlin(100194064)|#gene_synonym

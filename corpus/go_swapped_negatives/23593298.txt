Conversely, reduction of SKN-1 expression by RNAi led to a reduced GFP signal under standard conditions and to a significantly reduced induction of reporter gene expression under juglone stress (Figure 6).|#main_body|GO:0061987|negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter|Any process involving glucose that decreases the frequency, rate or extent or transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.|IMP|GOA|skn-1(177343)|#gene_synonym

Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA or circRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA or circRNA into protein.

Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA or circRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA or circRNA into protein.

23133401_14|23133401|13691|#section_info|588:1622|In wild-type ovaries, BP::GUS expression is primarily detected in the medial region, corresponding to the replum (Figure 3A) [19], [43]. When the JAG/FIL activity was compromised, we observed that the intensity of the BP::GUS signal increased and its expression domain expanded, achieving the widest domain in the fil yab3 jag triple mutant (Figure 3B-3F). The exception was the yab3 single mutant, in which the behavior of the BP::GUS reporter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (data not shown). Nevertheless, we observed by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) a significant increase in the expression levels of BP transcripts in the pistils of all backgrounds affected in JAG/FIL activity, including yab3 (Figure 3G). Therefore, these results and those shown in the previous section indicate that the JAG/FIL activity, functioning in valves and valve margins, negatively regulates BP expression in medial domains and that this repression is required for the correct specification of the replum.|#main_body|GO:0010628|positive regulation of gene expression|Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression.

23133401_19|23133401|19681|#section_info|268:993|We, therefore, studied the expression pattern of FIL in 35S::BP pistils by in situ hybridization, being unable to detect any signal of FIL transcripts (Figure 4G). We also analyzed the FIL::GFP reporter in 35S::BP gynoecia and observed a drastic reduction in GFP signal when compared to those of wild-type plants (Figure 4K and Figure S3C, S3F, S3I). Unlike the result of the in situ hybridization, in which no FIL expression was detected in 35S::BP ovaries, the reporter provided a slight but perceptible signal, possibly because of a higher sensitivity in the detection of GFP. All together these data strongly suggest that ectopically expressed BP, directly or indirectly, downregulates JAG/FIL activity genes in ovaries. |#main_body|GO:0010628|positive regulation of gene expression|Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression.

23133401_21|23133401|21480|#section_info|0:549|Our qRT-PCR mRNA quantification also showed that in both 35S::BP and as1 pistils JAG/FIL activity genes were downregulated, according to the results presented above (Figure 4N). Remarkably, higher relative levels of FIL messenger were detected in as1 when compared to 35S::BP, which might be explained by the stronger expression of BP in 35S::BP than in as1 background (our unpublished results). Therefore, all the results presented so far indicate that JAG/FIL activity represses BP, which in turn, negatively regulates the JAG/FIL activity genes. |#main_body|GO:0010628|positive regulation of gene expression|Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression.

The siz1-2 silique was significantly smaller than that of wild type 8-10 days after pollination (DAP; Figure 2A). Moreover, two significantly different populations of seeds were observed in the siliques of siz1-2, among which some seeds were well developed (Figure 2B, D). The others harbored desiccated ovules which might stop growing at early stages. Quantitative analysis showed that 23.3% (+-1.3%) of the ovules in siz1-2 siliques were desiccated, but only 1.0% (+-0.5%) of ovule was desiccated in the wild-type siliques (Figure 2F).|#main_body|GO:0048481|ovule development|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym
22253727_9|22253727|13183|#section_info|333:1103$$1099:1195|In contrast, the pollen tube behaved differently in siz1-2 and wild-type pistils during the gametophytic guidance stage. The pollen tubes in wild-type siliques grew along the funiculus and entered the female gametophyte successfully, after leaving the transmitting tract, 99.2% (n = 267) of ovules received pollen tubes (Figure 4C). In siz1-2 ovaries, 17.9% of ovules (130 of 724) did not have a pollen tube arriving at the micropylar opening. Some pollen tubes appeared to have lost their way soon after they grew out from the transmitting tract because they did not appear on the funiculus of some ovules (11.3%, n = 724) (Figure 4D, Figure S2). Other pollen tubes could grow on the funicular tissue, they even arrived near the micropylar opening of the ovules (6.6%,  6%, n = 724), but turned away and failed to enter the embryo sacs (Figure 4E, F, G, Figure S2).|#main_body|GO:0010183|pollen tube guidance|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym
22253727_11|22253727|16350|#section_info|0:879|Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pollen tubes could be seen adhering tightly to the funiculus and grow toward the micropyle, precisely entering the micropylar opening of the ovule in the wild-type siliques (Figure 4H). Although pollen tubes were present in most of the siz1-2 ovules, they behaved differently after presenting from the septum. Most of pollen tubes grew along the funiculus and entered the micropyle of some ovules in siz1-2 pistils (Figure 4I). However, the pollen tubes in other ovules failed to find the micropylar opening and grew without definite direction (Figure 4J, K, L); some of them bypassed the micropyle and grew on the ovule surface (Figure 4J) or even turned away (Figure 4K), or ceased to grow near the micropyle (Figure 4L). Furthermore, no pollen tube growth was found on the funiculus in a small proportion of siz1-2 ovules (Figure 4M).|#main_body|GO:0010183|pollen tube guidance|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym
22253727_15|22253727|17301|#section_info|473:838|We found that about half of the ovules in each silique at floral stage 12c from the siz1-2 seedlings were at developmental stage FG7, while the other ovules were at earlier stages, such as FG4, FG5, and FG6; no ovule harbored an abnormal embryo sac, similar to those in wild-type siliques, indicating that siz1-2 female gametophyte developed normally as far as FG7.|#main_body|GO:0009553|embryo sac development|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym
22253727_17|22253727|18487|#section_info|182:770|However, siz1-2 pistils contained 21.2% (n = 585 ovules) abnormal ovules, which had normal integument and distorted gametophytic cells within the embryo sac. As shown in Figure 6B, C, D, we did not detect any nucleus within the embryo sac of 10.1% of siz1-2 ovules, although profiles of gametophytic cells were clearly differentiated (Figure 6B). Additionally, 8.7% of the ovules harbored distorted embryo sacs and the gametophytic cells were permeated with fluorescent blocks (Figure 6C). Shrunken embryo sacs with weak fluorescent blocks were observed in the rest of the ovules (2.4%).|#main_body|GO:0009553|embryo sac development|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|SIZ1(836163)|#gene_synonym

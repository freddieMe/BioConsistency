17225858_1|17225858|86|#section_info|1038:1622|We found that the insertional mutation reduced the levels of Zea m 1 in maize pollen, but had no effect on pollen viability, in vitro pollen tube growth or the proportion of progeny sired when small pollen loads are deposited onto stigmas. However, when large pollen loads are deposited onto the stigmas, the transposon mutation is vastly underrepresented in the progeny, indicating that this major pollen allergen has a large effect on pollen tube growth rates in vivo, and plays an important role in determining the outcome of the pollen-pollen competition for access to the ovules.|#main_body|GO:0009860|pollen tube growth|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|EXP1(541904)|#gene_synonym
17225858_6|17225858|9222|#section_info|539:889|At 22 h after pollination, we found pollen tubes in 37.5% of the ovaries following pollinations by EXPB1 pollen (Figure 4). In contrast, we found no pollen tubes in the ovaries at 22 h after pollination when the silks were pollinated by expb1 pollen. Together these data indicate that the expb1 pollen grows more slowly in vivo than the EXPB1 pollen.|#main_body|GO:0009860|pollen tube growth|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|expb1(542106)|#gene_synonym
17225858_8|17225858|9222|#section_info|227:505|When we examined the silks at 8 h after pollination, we found that silks pollinated with EXPB1 pollen contained a significantly greater number of pollen tubes (2.18+-0.09; mean+-SE) at 8 cm below the site of pollen deposition than silks pollinated with expb1 pollen (0.98+-0.06)|#main_body|GO:0009860|pollen tube growth|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|EXPB1(542106)|#gene_synonym

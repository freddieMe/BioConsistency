18385140_5|18385140|17762|#section_info|683:1148|To biochemically confirm the IF results, we isolated highly purified mitochondria from homogenized rat kidneys by differential centrifugation followed by histodenz gradient purification. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous DSP18 was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with the mitochondrial protein marker SMAC, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum protein marker calreticulin was removed during histodenz gradient purification (Fig. 3E).|#main_body|GO:0016007|mitochondrial derivative|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp18(305477)|#gene_synonym
18385140_6|18385140|18911|#section_info|284:453|Gold particles were found predominantly within mitochondria, suggesting DSP18 is localized to either the matrix, IM, or IMS, possibly the intra-cristal spaces (Fig. 3F).|#main_body|GO:1990843|subsarcolemmal mitochondrion|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp18(305477)|#gene_synonym
18385140_7|18385140|19505|#section_info|869:1133|DSP18 was enriched in the inner membrane-containing SMP and MP fractions (Fig. 4B), similar to PTPMT1, a known integral membrane protein located on the matrix side of the IM (16). A trace amount of DSP18 was also seen in the soluble matrix (SM) fraction (Fig. 4B).|#main_body|GO:0031305|integral to mitochondrial inner membrane|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp18(305477)|#gene_synonym
18385140_9|18385140|21800|#section_info|489:631|However, DSP18 showed no loss of signal from SMP treated with trypsin, suggesting that DSP18 is attached to the IM facing the IMS compartment.|#main_body|GO:0005743|mitochondrial inner membrane|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp18(305477)|#gene_synonym
18385140_10|18385140|25828|#section_info|597:842|Western blot analysis demonstrated that DSP21 was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with the mitochondrial marker VDAC; however, the endoplasmic reticulum marker, calreticulin, was removed after gradient purification (Fig. 5F).|#main_body|GO:1990843|subsarcolemmal mitochondrion|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp21(302867)|#gene_synonym
18385140_11|18385140|26924|#section_info|495:636|The observation that DSP21 was enriched in both the SMP and MP fractions but not the OM suggests that DSP21 is localized to the IM (Fig. 6A).|#main_body|GO:0005743|mitochondrial inner membrane|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp21(302867)|#gene_synonym
18385140_12|18385140|26924|#section_info|1709:1950|This indicates that DSP21, like DSP18, is a peripheral membrane protein, and collectively these data suggest that DSP21 is localized to mitochondria in testis tissue where it peripherally associates with the IM within the matrix compartment.|#main_body|GO:0031305|integral to mitochondrial inner membrane|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|dusp21(302867)|#gene_synonym

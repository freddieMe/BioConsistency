17908240_14|17908240|25579|#section_info|480:786$$991:1424|To determine whether PKC or Ca2+/CaM were responsible for M1 mACh receptor-mediated MARCKS translocation the following protocol was used. Neurons were stimulated with MCh (3 mumol/L) for 30 s (S1) and then washed to allow recovery of MARCKS to baseline levels. Neurons were then treated with staurosporine  Neurons were then subjected to a second MCh (3 mumol/L, 30 s) challenge (S2). Comparison of S1 and S2 responses indicated that MCh-stimulated eGFP-MARCKS translocation was almost completely inhibited following staurosporine treatment (Fig. 5c and d), while W7 and W5 treatments were without effect (Fig. 5d). These data suggest that agonist-driven eGFP-MARCKS translocation is mediated through PKC activation in hippocampal neurons.|#main_body|GO:0042308|negative regulation of protein import into nucleus|Any process that decreases the frequency, rate or extent of the directed movement of proteins within cells.|IEP|GOA|Chrm1(25229)|#gene_synonym

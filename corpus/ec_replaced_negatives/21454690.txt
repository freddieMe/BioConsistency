A protein construct incorporating both tandem PTB domains (AS160(1-532)) inhibited fusion very potently, and the highest protein concentration tested inhibited fusion completely (Fig. 1D).|#main_body|GO:1905363|positive regulation of endosomal vesicle fusion|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of vesicle fusion.|IGI|GOA|AS160(686547)|#gene_synonym

21454690_8|21454690|20450|#section_info|935:1414|The levels of precipitation by 14-3-3gamma were 15-17-fold greater from insulin-treated lysates compared with basal lysates, reflecting the higher level of phosphorylation and therefore more available sites for interaction with 14-3-3. In addition, the gamma isoform relatively selectively pulled down phosphorylated AS160 from adipocyte lysates as determined using an antibody that recognizes a wide range of phosphorylated Akt substrates (anti-PAS antibody) (Fig. 2, E and F). |#main_body|GO:0032869|cellular response to insulin stimulus|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|YwhaG(56010)|#gene_synonym

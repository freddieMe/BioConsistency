23133401_19|23133401|19681|#section_info|268:993|We, therefore, studied the expression pattern of FIL in 35S::BP pistils by in situ hybridization, being unable to detect any signal of FIL transcripts (Figure 4G). We also analyzed the FIL::GFP reporter in 35S::BP gynoecia and observed a drastic reduction in GFP signal when compared to those of wild-type plants (Figure 4K and Figure S3C, S3F, S3I). Unlike the result of the in situ hybridization, in which no FIL expression was detected in 35S::BP ovaries, the reporter provided a slight but perceptible signal, possibly because of a higher sensitivity in the detection of GFP. All together these data strongly suggest that ectopically expressed BP, directly or indirectly, downregulates JAG/FIL activity genes in ovaries. |#main_body|GO:0010629|negative regulation of gene expression|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|BP(826364)|#gene_synonym

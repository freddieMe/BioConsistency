22952820_11|22952820|15074|#section_info|909:1230|In contrast, we found a slight increase in the level of mtDNA throughout adult life in the wild type overexpressing line (Figure 5B), an observation consistent with the results reported upon overexpression or Twinkle in mice [11], reinforcing the idea that the mtDNA helicase is limiting for mtDNA replication in animals.|#main_body|GO:0006264|mitochondrial DNA replication|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|d-mtDNA helicase(34307)|#gene_synonym

23155454_4|23155454|5955|#section_info|0:313|We isolated a recessive mutant that had defective ER morphology from chemically mutagenized GFP-h and designated it the endoplasmic reticulum morphology3-1 (ermo3-1) mutant. This mutant developed a huge aggregate of ER and a number of punctate structures on the peripheral meshwork of cotyledon cells (Figure 1A).|#main_body|GO:0048309|endoplasmic reticulum inheritance|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|ermo3(841841)|#gene_synonym

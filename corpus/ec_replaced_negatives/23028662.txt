23028662_5|23028662|14217|#section_info|211:888|When examined at 1 day post-eclosion (PE), mushroom body axonal lobes overexpressing Rheb (OK107>GFP, Rheb) were greatly expanded as compared to the mushroom bodies of control animals (OK107>GFP; Fig. 1B). All portions of the lobe appeared enlarged. Neuropil volume was significantly larger for OK107>GFP, Rheb animals (173517.6 microm3+-20829.3) than for OK107>GFP animals (64514.8 microm3+-5186.3) at 1 day PE (Fig. 1E). However, the overall structure and proportionality of the lobes appeared intact. No obvious large-scale misrouting or deletions were observed, and upon close examination of image Z-stacks, the expanded lobes did not invade the opposite brain hemisphere. |#main_body|GO:0021551|central nervous system morphogenesis|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Rheb(117332)|#gene_synonym

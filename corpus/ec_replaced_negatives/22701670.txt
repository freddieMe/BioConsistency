22701670_7|22701670|10731|#section_info|161:1042|Suppression of Tap42 in the pnr domain resulted in the appearance of a marked thorax cleft (Fig. 1-B2), but the wings appeared normal (Fig. 1-C2). In comparison to pnr-Gal4 activity, ap-Gal4 activity extends from the stalk to the dorsal/ventral boundary and not only includes the notum, but hinge and wing compartments as well (Fig. 1-A2). As expected, given the broader activity of the ap-Gal4 driver in the wing discs, Drosophila lines expressing Tap42RNAi under the control of ap-Gal4 exhibited more complex phenotypes that included varying degrees of a cleft thorax (Fig. 1-B3) as well as significant wing deformities (Fig. 1-C3). Necrosis of the front leg joints was also observed in some of these flies (Fig. S2-B). These findings suggest that Tap42 is involved in wing imaginal disc morphogenesis and plays a crucial role in the patterning and differentiation of wing discs.|#main_body|GO:0007472|wing disc morphogenesis|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym
22701670_8|22701670|20283|#section_info|453:730|However, major external morphological defects could only be detected in the adult thorax and wing (Fig. 2-A1), thus suggesting that Tap42 plays a crucial role in the development of the wing disc but relatively minor roles in other discs such as the eye, haltere, and leg discs.|#main_body|GO:0035220|wing disc development|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym
22701670_9|22701670|21083|#section_info|774:1076|However, silencing of Tap42 in the ap gene domain had a profound effect on the JNK activity pattern in the wing discs, especially along the ventral/dorsal boundary, as evident by hyperphosphorylation of JNK in the dorsal side and almost complete loss of p-JNK in the ventral part (Fig. 3-A3 & Fig. S1).|#main_body|GO:0046328|regulation of JNK cascade|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym
22701670_10|22701670|23657|#section_info|0:348|We utilized the dpp-LacZ reporter to determine whether DPP expression was altered in Tap42RNAi-expressing wing discs. X-GAL staining revealed that ap-Gal4-mediated RNAi silencing of Tap42 increased dpp gene expression around the wing blade but effectively eliminated its expression in the scutellum area, as compared with control flies (Fig. 3-C3).|#main_body|GO:0030510|regulation of BMP signaling pathway|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym

The double mutant also exhibited blistered, albeit more developed wings, as compared to the totally shriveled wings seen in the ap-Gal4>UAS-Tap42RNAi flies (compare Figs. 1-C3 & 5-B5).|#main_body|GO:0007472|wing disc morphogenesis|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Tap42(326166)|#gene_synonym

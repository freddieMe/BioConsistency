To compare the effects of NijA to a known apoptosis inducer, we drove the expression of hid with hml-GAL4, and found a similar loss of GFP-labeled cells (Fig. 3D).|#main_body|GO:0001896|autolysis|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|NijA(39215)|#gene_synonym
23028562_14|23028562|15820|#section_info|0:551|We examined dissected lymph glands expressing NijA. Although 7/7 control (hml>GFP) lymph glands did not stain with acridine orange, which can only permeate dead cells, in contrast all lymph glands expressing either NijA or the apoptosis inducer hid stained brightly with acridine orange (7 of each genotype, compare Fig. 3G-I'). The dying cells appeared to be restricted to differentiated cells that express hml, as undifferentiated hemocytes expressing hemese but not hml were still present in lymph glands expressing hml>NijA or hml>hid (Fig. 2J-L).|#main_body|GO:0097300|programmed necrotic cell death|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|NijA(39215)|#gene_synonym

In contrast, when cells were co-transfected with NijA and GFP, only 9% of cells expressed GFP, and 37% of the cultured cells were dead as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 5A).|#main_body|GO:0006915|apoptotic process|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|NijA(39215)|#gene_synonym

23028562_22|23028562|22364|#section_info|1680:2074|Surprisingly, two mutants seemed to increase the potency of NijA, as D124A or the double mutant K131A, K132A were more toxic to cells than wild-type NijA, resulting in no GFP-positive cells; yet because the fraction of dead cells was similar to the sum of the baseline death rate plus the transfection rate, it appears that this overactive toxic mutant still killed in a cell-autonomous manner.|#main_body|GO:0001896|autolysis|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|NijA(39215)|#gene_synonym

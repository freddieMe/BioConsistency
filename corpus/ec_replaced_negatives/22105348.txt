22105348_39|22105348|24510|#section_info|0:1198|Although the results from the S2R+ experiments allowed us to narrow down the portion of Crb required for interaction with MyoV, they also showed that in this system, Crb could ectopically recruit MyoV to the plasma membrane. Despite the extremely simplified nature of the S2R+ system in comparison with PRCs and the fact that in crb mutant photoreceptors, the residual MyoV localization is predominantly WT, we tested whether or not Crb is capable of performing the same function in PRCs. Using Rh1-Gal4, we expressed either full-length Crb (CrbFull length) or a construct of Crb in which the extracellular domain of Crb has been replaced by a Flag tag (CrbFlag intra). Although both of these transgene-encoded proteins localize ectopically to the rhabdomere base and basolateral membranes, as previously described (Richard et al., 2009), neither is able to recruit MyoV to these sites (Fig. 5, E and F). Therefore, we conclude that the S2R+ experiments can be used only as a basic method to analyze the domains for the Crb-MyoV interaction and that the physiologically relevant role of this interaction in the adult photoreceptor is not one of recruitment/localization but rather of stabilization.|#main_body|GO:0050821|protein stabilization|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|crb(42896)|#gene_synonym

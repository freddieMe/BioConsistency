22022278_2|22022278|19303|#section_info|468:860|In contrast, mus312 mus309 mutants have small brains, lack imaginal discs, and have a reduced number of salivary imaginal cells (Figure 3). Nuclei of the remaining salivary imaginal cells appear larger than in wild-type larvae, suggesting increased DNA content. These phenotypes indicate that MUS312-SLX1 has a more critical role in proliferation in the early larva than MUS81-MMS4 (Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0010463|mesenchymal cell proliferation|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|mus312(38809)|#gene_synonym

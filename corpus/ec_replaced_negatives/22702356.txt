After the UV-B treatment, C2 promoter sequences in Confite plants were increased in the fractions immunoprecipitated with alphaP1; in contrast, similar levels of immunoprecipitate were measured in W23 samples with or without the UV-B treatment (Figure  2B).|#main_body|GO:0071493|cellular response to UV-B|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|p1(542272)|#gene_synonym

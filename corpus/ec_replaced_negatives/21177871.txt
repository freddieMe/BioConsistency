21177871_1|21177871|18381|#section_info|0:291$$295:400|In order to identify small molecules disrupting AKAP-PKA interactions, we developed an ELISA-based screening assay, where full-length AKAP18delta was added to RIIalpha subunits of PKA bound to 384-well microtiter plates. Interaction was detected using primary antibodies specific for AKAP18d , secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, and a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Fig. 1A) (12).|#main_body|GO:0034237|protein kinase A regulatory subunit binding|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Akap7(361458)|#gene_synonym

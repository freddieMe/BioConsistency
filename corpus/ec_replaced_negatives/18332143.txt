18332143_5|18332143|12461|#section_info|257:800|Samples of p97 were heat-denatured, the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was examined spectroscopically. The supernatant had an absorption maximum at 260 nm, consistent with adenine-based nucleotides. Further analysis by HPLC showed co-elution with ADP but not with ATP controls (data not shown), indicating that ADP is prebound to our p97 preparations. We quantified the amount of ADP prebound to p97 and found that typically 0.9 +- 0.2 molecules of ADP were present per p97 monomer (Fig. 2A).|#main_body|GO:0043531|ADP binding|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|vcp(116643)|#gene_synonym
18332143_6|18332143|13262|#section_info|253:480|However, p97 mutated in D2 alone (K524A) contained a similar amount of prebound ADP as wild type, whereas p97 mutated in D1, either alone (K251A) or in combination with D2 (K251A,K524A), contained little prebound ADP (Fig. 2A).|#main_body|GO:0043531|ADP binding|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|vcp(116643)|#gene_synonym

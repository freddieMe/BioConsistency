22291037_13|22291037|14703|#section_info|334:599|Examination of S2 cells expressing GFP-tagged Sec71 revealed that it was associated with the Golgi and overlapped with a trans-Golgi marker (dGolgin245) while being clearly distinct from a cis-Golgi marker (dGM130), indicating a trans-Golgi localization (Fig. 3 A).|#main_body|GO:0005802|trans-Golgi network|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Sec71(34785)|#gene_synonym
22291037_14|22291037|14703|#section_info|600:810|When Arl1-RFP was coexpressed with Sec71-GFP, the two proteins showed a very similar distribution, and, again, this overlapped the trans-Golgi protein while being clearly distinct from the cis-Golgi (Fig. 3 B).|#main_body|GO:0005802|trans-Golgi network|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Arl1(39745)|#gene_synonym
22291037_19|22291037|16348|#section_info|113:801|It has been reported that the N-terminal 561 residues of human BIG1 are sufficient for Golgi targeting in mammalian cells (Mansour et al., 1999). When the equivalent region of Sec71 was expressed in S2 cells, it showed only weak Golgi staining (Fig. 4 B). However, when it was coexpressed with Drosophila Arl1, this N-terminal region was efficiently recruited to the Golgi (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the region of Sec71 C terminal to the Sec7 domain was diffusely distributed in the cytosol, irrespective of Arl1 overexpression. This indicates that Arl1 recruits Sec71 to Golgi membranes, but it appears that Arl1's effects are augmented by additional interactions elsewhere in the protein.|#main_body|GO:0000042|protein targeting to Golgi|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Arl1(39745)|#gene_synonym
22291037_22|22291037|18302|#section_info|0:311|To determine whether Arl1 was interacting directly with Sec71, the N-terminal region of Sec71 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified.

Representative Golgi regions in the boxed areas are shown magnified in the insets. In cells lacking Arl1, the GRIP domain protein golgin-245 or GCC88 is displaced from the Golgi as expected. In such cells, BIG1 and BIG2 are also displaced from the Golgi, whereas other Golgi proteins are apparently unaffected. |#fig_caption|GO:0000042|protein targeting to Golgi|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|Arl1(39745)|#gene_synonym

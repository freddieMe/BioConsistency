21911368_6|21911368|27185|#section_info|1090:1320|(C) The ssDNA-binding activity of Whirly proteins was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using crude plastid protein extracts isolated from plants of the indicated genotypes and a radiolabeled dT32 oligonucleotide. |#fig_caption|GO:0003697|single-stranded DNA binding|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|WHY1(838003)|#gene_synonym

Indeed, when we introduce an At-WHY1 transgene into the ciprofloxacin-sensitive why1 why3 background, we are able to rescue, for the most part, the plant resistance to the antibiotic.|#main_body|GO:0006281|DNA repair|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|WHY1(838003)|#gene_synonym

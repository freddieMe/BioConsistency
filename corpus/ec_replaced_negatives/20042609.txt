Quantitation of the levels of phosphorylated AKT relative to total AKT was performed using scanning densitometry. This demonstrated statistically significant differences only seen 3 and 4 h after strain.|#main_body|GO:0071260|cellular response to mechanical stimulus|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Akt1(24185)|#gene_synonym

Quantitative densitometry demonstrated that these differences were only statistically significant 3 and 4 h after strain. Similarly, there was a strain-dependent increase in active beta-catenin 1 and 2 h following strain, again peaking after 3 and 4 h.  again peaking after 3 and 4 h. Statistical analysis of densitometric scans revealed that these differences were only significant 3 and 4 h following strain. |#main_body|GO:0071260|cellular response to mechanical stimulus|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|gsk3b(84027)|#gene_synonym

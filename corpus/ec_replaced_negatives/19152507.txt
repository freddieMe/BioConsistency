19152507_6|19152507|21912|#section_info|0:857|Inhibition of CYPOR activity in brain membranes was achieved by incubation of brain membranes (1 mg protein/ml) with an antibody against CYPOR (alpha-CYPOR, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.; 0.33 or 1 mg/ml) for 2 h on ice. Unlike after incubation with 1 mg/ml of control gamma-immunoglobulins or buffer alone, both antibody concentrations dramatically reduced the activity of CYPOR, as assessed by the ability of brain membranes to reduce cytochrome c (Figure 2B). Similarly, NADPH-dependent NO consumption was reduced by incubation with 0.33 mg/ml alpha-CYPOR, but not by gamma-immunoglobulins or buffer (Figure 2C), indicating that NO consumption by brain membranes is dependent on CYPOR activity. The degree of inhibition by alpha-CYPOR was similar to that produced by DPI (Figures 2C and 2D), as would be expected if both are targeting the same protein (CYPOR).|#main_body|GO:0046210|nitric oxide catabolic process|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Por(29441)|#gene_synonym

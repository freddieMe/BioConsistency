The banding on the abdomen appeared severed, causing a misalignment of symmetry between the tergites.|#main_body|GO:0008365|adult chitin-based cuticle development|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Cyp301a1(36378)|#gene_synonym

22574182_10|22574182|18055|#section_info|589:1214|Akin to the previous phenotypic classifications used, Cyp301a1 adult progeny were classed in order of cuticle phenotype severity (Figure 4A). At 25 C, 61(+-7)% of flies emerged with no phenotype, 17(+-3)% of RNAi progeny emerged with a slight cuticle malformation and 22(+-7)% of RNAi progeny emerged with a severe cuticle phenotype from all three lines (Figure 4B). The cuticle phenotype was equally prevalent in males and females (Figure 4A). These RNAi results corroborate those reported for the Cyp301a1f02301 insertion strain, suggesting that a loss of Cyp301a1 is likely to be responsible for the cuticle malformation.|#main_body|GO:0008365|adult chitin-based cuticle development|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|Cyp301a1(36378)|#gene_synonym

21987638_47|21987638|18167|#section_info|0:909|We tested for a genetic interaction between PP2ATws and Plk4 by depleting PP2ATws in S2 cells expressing a Plk4 construct harboring a Slimb-binding mutation (SBM; a nonphosphorylatable alanine [S293A/T297A] mutation), which prevents Slimb binding (Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2009). Like Slimb RNAi, Plk4-SBM expression increased the percentage of cells containing greater than two centrioles (Fig. 3 C; Rogers et al., 2009).

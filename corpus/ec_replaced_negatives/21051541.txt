21051541_1|21051541|19297|#section_info|687:919|To test whether TDP-43 exists in high molecular mass complexes in the brain, we took rat brain nuclear extracts and applied the extracts to a gel filtration column. Similar trends were observed as in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B).|#main_body|GO:0005634|nucleus|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Tardbp(298648)|#gene_synonym

Three of the mutations that we identified in this screen appeared to be alleles of the same gene, since they all mapped to the gene cluster on chromosome IV, failed to complement each other and exhibited a similar combination of phenotypes, i.e., suppression of gon-2(q388) (Figure 1A), slow growth (Gro), and egg-laying-defective (Egl). We recognized the latter two phenotypes as similar to those of a deletion/candidate null allele of the gtl-2 locus (tm1463), which also maps to the chromosome IV gene cluster.|#main_body|GO:0000003|reproduction|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|WBGene00001651(172646)|#gene_synonym

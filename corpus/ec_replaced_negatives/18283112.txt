First, we noticed an increased proportion of cells in metaphase compared with the other stages of cell division, showing that moesin depletion caused a delay in anaphase onset (Fig. 1 A).|#main_body|GO:0007091|metaphase/anaphase transition of mitotic cell cycle|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|Moe(31816)|#gene_synonym

Furthermore, as early as prophase and until telophase, moesin-depleted cells displayed large and transient cytoplasmic bulges that deformed the mitotic cortex (Fig. 1, B and C; and see Fig. 4 B).

18283112_42|18283112|4515|#section_info|1097:1561|Consistent with a role of moesin in the regulation of cortical contractility during mitosis, localization of contractile factors at the cortex was abnormal in dividing moesin-depleted cells.

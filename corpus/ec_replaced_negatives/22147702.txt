Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death.|IEP|GOA|alpha-TTP(25571)|#gene_synonym

In contrast, the viability of McA-TTP cells remained high (84% of non-treatment controls) under the same regimen.|#main_body|GO:0043068|positive regulation of programmed cell death|Any process that increases the rate or frequency of cell death.

21730358_8|21730358|18678|#section_info|206:682|A total of five independent transgenic lines with the 35S::ZCN8 construct were selected for flowering time analysis; lines Z2 and Z5 were created by transforming the 35S::ZCN8 construct directly into ft-1 mutant plants, and X2, Y1 and F3 lines carried the construct in Ler WT plants. For most of these lines, flowering time was shown to be significantly earlier than in WT or ft-1 mutant plants under inductive LD conditions (Fig. 3A; 4A Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).|#main_body|GO:0009648|photoperiodism|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|ZCN8(100127519)|#gene_synonym

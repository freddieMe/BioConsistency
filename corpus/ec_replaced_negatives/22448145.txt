22448145_17|22448145|10897|#section_info|239:1167|We focused our analysis on transheterozygous escapers (HV/FB) and clones of the PB allele. Both have normal ERGs (Figure 1F), with no obvious developmental defects, and possess the correct number of photoreceptors per ommatidium in 1-d-old animals (Figure 2A-C). They display no defects in their rhabdomeres, and the overall appearance of the PRs also appears normal. As shown in Figure 2D-E and 2G, the PRs and support cells (glia) progressively degenerate. By 2 wk of age, the PRs of HV/FB animals display more severe phenotypes, and some PRs are vacuolated (arrowhead, Figure 2D). By 3 wk of age, most PRs are severely affected and many organelles are barely recognizable (Figure 2E,G). Similarly, in mutant clones of the piggyBac (PB), PRs are mostly normal at day 1 (Figure 2C) and become severely affected by 2 wk of age (Figure 2F). In summary, different mutations cause a severe progressive degeneration of PRs and glia.|#main_body|GO:0045494|photoreceptor cell maintenance|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Aats-met(41733)|#gene_synonym

22448145_23|22448145|14245|#section_info|385:839|Interestingly, the myofibrils seem intact at 1 d of age (Figure 3A,C), but the mitochondria are clearly aberrant: they are larger than normal (Figure 3C-E). In 1-wk-old HV/FB flies, the myofibrils display defects (arrowhead in Figure 3D), and the mitochondria are very large (Figure 3D-E). At 2 wk of age the muscle is too fragmented to take TEM images.

22448145_27|22448145|23152|#section_info|229:719|Hence, we hypothesized that the reduced cell proliferation in Aats-met mutants may be caused by elevated levels of ROS. Since mitochondrial aconitase activity is highly sensitive to ROS [45],[46], we measured aconitase activity normalized to total protein levels and found it to be greatly reduced (Figure 5C). Upon addition of a reducing agent, the aconitase activity is restored in the mutants, showing that aconitase is indeed more oxidized in the mutants than in the wild-type controls.|#main_body|GO:0002148|hypochlorous acid metabolic process|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Aats-met(41733)|#gene_synonym

We therefore tested if these phenotypes can be suppressed by antioxidants and supplemented with food with the lipophilic/cell-permeable Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and water-soluble N-acetylcysteine amide (AD4) [47]. We scored the loss of the glossy patch and the number of ommatidia. As shown in Figure 5D-E, low levels of Vitamin E (20 microg/ml) significantly improved eye morphology and size (p<0.001). In addition, the percentage of adult female escapers of the genotype HV/FB able to eclose at room temperature increased significantly with antioxidants, although this was not observed in males (Figure 5F). |#main_body|GO:0006801|superoxide metabolic process|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Aats-met(41733)|#gene_synonym

22772985_29|22772985|18263|#section_info|0:546|From the list of modulated genes, we found that RDR2 and DCL3, which encode necessary factors in siRNA biogenesis and the RdDM pathway, were obviously decreased in ibm1; in contrast, RDR6 and DCL4, homologs of RDR2 and DCL3 with divergent functions, remained unchanged in ibm1 compared with WT plants (Supplementary Table S3). Further examination by qPCR verified the downregulation of RDR2 and DCL3 in ibm1. However, there was no significant difference in the expression of NRPD1A and AGO4, two other key members of the RdDM pathway (Figure 1c).|#main_body|GO:0006355|regulation of transcription, DNA-templated|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

22772985_37|22772985|20484|#section_info|0:529|In WT plants, the H3K9me2 level was extremely low across RDR2 and DCL3 (Figure 2b, c and e), which is consistent with the active function of these genes in growth and development. The H3K9me2 levels in ibm1 were distinctly increased in regions P2 and P3, which represent the gene body of RDR2 (Figure 2b and c). In addition, the level of H3K4me3, which is a gene activation marker and antagonist to H3K9me2, was obviously reduced in ibm1 in the intragenic, but not in the upstream or downstream region, of RDR2 (Figure 2b and d).|#main_body|GO:0033169|histone H3-K9 demethylation|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym
22772985_39|22772985|21014|#section_info|0:380|Nearly the same results were obtained for DCL3 by ChIP: the H3K9me2 level was distinctly increased in regions P2-P7 of the DCL gene body, whereas the H3K4me3 level in DCL3 chromatin was regulated in an antagonistic manner to H3K9me2 in ibm1 (Figure 2b, e and f).

22772985_43|22772985|23157|#section_info|129:678|To investigate the direct association of IBM1 with RDR2 and DCL3 chromatin, we performed a ChIP assay using transgenic plants expressing 35S::YFP::IBM1 in an ibm1-3 background. The integrated IBM1 in the transgenic plants was expressed (Figure 3d) and was exclusively nuclear-localized in protoplasts (Figure 3a). Also, a functional YFP-IBM1 fusion protein was produced in vivo, as demonstrated by its ability to complement all of the mutant phenotypes of ibm1-3, including its embryonic defect and abnormally sharp rosette leaves (Figure 3b and c).|#main_body|GO:0031492|nucleosomal DNA binding|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

Using a bisulfite assay, the intragenic regions of RDR2 (+2509 to +2702) and DCL3 (+4204 to +4396) were amplified, cloned and sequenced. The regions in RDR2 and DCL3 selected for bisulfite sequencing had the highest IBM1 occupancy and greatest increase in H3K9me2 in ibm1 (Figure 4).|#main_body|GO:0043046|DNA methylation involved in gamete generation|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

22772985_61|22772985|33943|#section_info|0:958|Using mRNA-Seq, the reads that mapped to exons of SDC were distinctly enriched in ibm1-3 (Supplementary Figure S4a and Supplementary Table S3). In addition, qPCR confirmed the >=20-fold accumulation of SDC mRNA in all three ibm1 alleles (Supplementary Figure S4b). Subsequently, we analyzed DNA methylation in the entire tandem repeats and in the regions upstream and downstream of the SDC repeats by bisulfite sequencing. In WT plants, all of the sequence contexts were densely methylated (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7). Consistent with this, DNA methylation at CHG and CHH sites in the SDC tandem repeats was slightly reduced in the ibm1 alleles, whereas that in the regions flanking the repeats was not obviously changed (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7).

Our real-time PCR results confirmed that the mRNA levels of these randomly selected genes were upregulated in ibm1-3 (Figure 6a).

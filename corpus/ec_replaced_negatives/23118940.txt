23118940_47|23118940|37746|#section_info|137:616|After 7 days of induction, when PXVE:NF-YA2 seedlings show a decrease in growth rate, seedlings showed a better survival to heat and freezing stress compared to WT. The reduction in growth rate was determined by monitoring the repression of EXL (Figure S14A and S14B), a gene involved in growth promotion process [41]. A control line constitutively overexpressing NF-YA2 (P35S:NF-YA2) performed significantly better than the WT at both short and long exposure times (Figure 10E).|#main_body|GO:0070370|cellular heat acclimation|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|NF-YA2(819738)|#gene_synonym

Therefore, it is possible that NF-YAs could act both as transcriptional activators of genes, whose promoters contain the CCAAT-box (as previously documented in other systems) and as repressors of a subset of genes that lack the CCAAT-box.|#main_body|GO:0043484|regulation of RNA splicing|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|NF-YA2(819738)|#gene_synonym

20410303_2|20410303|23323|#section_info|1174:1442|Interestingly, AKAP150-HA was also shown to interact with the C terminus of AC8 (Fig. 1A, lane 4), although there was no evidence of AKAP79-HA interaction with this domain, suggesting differences in the specific interactions between these two AKAP orthologues and AC8.|#main_body|GO:0008179|adenylate cyclase binding|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Akap5(171026)|#gene_synonym
20410303_3|20410303|34162|#section_info|738:844|Interestingly, expression of AKAP150-HA potentiated the degree of Ca2+-stimulated AC8 activity (p < 0.05).|#main_body|GO:0075077|negative regulation by host of symbiont adenylate cyclase activity|Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of adenylate cyclase activity.|IEP|GOA|Akap5(171026)|#gene_synonym
20410303_4|20410303|44099|#section_info|1486:1620|In MIN6 cells transiently transfected with AKAP150-HA, the amplitude of Ca2+-stimulated cAMP production was reduced (Fig. 7, B and C).|#main_body|GO:0075107|positive regulation by symbiont of host adenylate cyclase activity|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of adenylate cyclase activity.|IPI|GOA|Akap5(171026)|#gene_synonym
20410303_5|20410303|50484|#section_info|1075:1369|This effect of AKAP150 overexpression is again consistent with the attenuating effects of AKAP79 on AC8 activity in HEK293 cells and of AKAP150 on AC8 activity in MIN6 cells, which suggests that AKAP79/150 dampens Ca2+-dependent AC8 activity as a consequence of its interaction with the enzyme.|#main_body|GO:0075107|positive regulation by symbiont of host adenylate cyclase activity|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of adenylate cyclase activity.|IEP|GOA|Akap5(171026)|#gene_synonym

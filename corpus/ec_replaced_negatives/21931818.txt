21931818_3|21931818|16643|#section_info|1618:1786|Based on these data, S_4294 in exon 6 was predicted to be the functional mutation of Zmfatb that causes the observed phenotypic changes in palmitic acid-related traits.|#main_body|GO:0019432|triglyceride biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|fatb(fat2)|#gene_synonym
21931818_4|21931818|22122|#section_info|789:1027|The phenotypic variation explained by this InDel varied from 5% for UFA/ALL to 16% for C16:0/ALL (Table 2). This provides strong additional evidence that the 11-bp InDel in the sixth exon of Zmfatb is the causal polymorphism of QTL-Pal9.|#main_body|GO:0019432|triglyceride biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|fatb(fat2)|#gene_synonym

21931818_7|21931818|36115|#section_info|866:1249|The effect of the 11-bp InDel is stable across different genetic backgrounds (Table S8) and the insertion can reduce palmitic acid levels (C16:0) by an average of 1 mg/g, and palmitic acid concentration (C16:0/ALL) by 20%. The 11-bp InDel at Zmfatb has no measured effects on other agronomic traits including total kernel oil content, kernel width and kernel length (data not shown).|#main_body|GO:0019432|triglyceride biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|fatb(fat2)|#gene_synonym

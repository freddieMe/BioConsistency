By contrast, both kcs18 homozygous mutants had a strongly reduced CLR compared to wild type. kcs18-1 displayed a much stronger CLR reduction than kcs18-2 (Fig. 3C), which correlated with the reduction in the level of KCS18 transcript, suggesting that CLR.2 is likely due to variation at KCS18.|#main_body|GO:0042761|very long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|KCS18(829603)|#gene_synonym

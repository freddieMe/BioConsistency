22417282_6|22417282|8865|#section_info|0:129|Exposure of corn seedlings to DTT, did, indeed, result in splicing of ZmbZIP60, and the spliced form was recovered and sequenced.|#main_body|GO:0034976|response to endoplasmic reticulum stress|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|bZIP60(100280864)|#gene_synonym
22417282_7|22417282|9701|#section_info|536:712|When DTT was added to the hydroponic medium, spliced forms of ZmbZIP60 were detected by the FP assay in root tissue 30 min after treatment and increased thereafter (Figure 3A).|#main_body|GO:0034976|response to endoplasmic reticulum stress|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|bZIP60(100280864)|#gene_synonym

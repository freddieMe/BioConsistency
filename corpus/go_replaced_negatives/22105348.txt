22105348_24|22105348|15143|#section_info|0:0|To investigate the cause of MyoV loss observed in crb mutant photoreceptors, we aimed to prevent the loss of MyoV by overexpression of a dominant-negative proteasome subunit Pros2612B (Belote and Fortier, 2002). This resulted in a marked increase in MyoV staining (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 2 D). Quantification of MyoV fluorescence (normalized to WT MyoV fluorescence per ommatidium, as described in Materials and methods) showed that the reduction of MyoV seen in crb mutant photoreceptors is rescued to ~80% of that seen in WT ommatidia upon proteasome inhibition in comparison with ~50% in the absence of proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 2 E).

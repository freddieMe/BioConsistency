22879948_6|22879948|22629|#section_info|904:1205|In the case of Mad, an overexpression with A9-Gal4 leads to a dramatic reduction in wing size, ectopic vein tissue and blistering (Fig. 4C). Coexpression of Fuss restores not only the size of the wing, but leads also to a notable amelioration of the vein-, respectively intervein patterning (Fig. 4D).|#main_body|GO:1902814|positive regulation of BMP signaling pathway involved in determination of lateral mesoderm left/right asymmetry|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of BMP signaling pathway activity.|IMP|GOA|fuss(192347)|#gene_synonym

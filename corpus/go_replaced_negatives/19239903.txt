19239903_14|19239903|10179|#section_info|0:329|Ethanol induced the downregulation of a ~28 kDa protein (protein 3 by 1D PAGE) with a pI of ~8.3 (protein 5 by 1D IEF); physical characteristics consistent with protein spots 9-11 from 2D-PAGE. In all cases excision of this protein and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS identified this protein as carbonic anhydrase-III (CA-III, Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0071361|cellular response to ethanol|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|Car3(54232)|#gene_synonym

19239903_11|19239903|8859|#section_info|0:0|The combination of these three protein separation methods enabled us to characterise 11 prominent liver cytosolic protein changes, and provided information overlap to facilitate verification of protein changes by more than one physical property and separation technique. Thus a ~45 kDa protein with a pI of ~10 conforms to the characteristics of protein 1 (by 1D PAGE), protein 4 (by 1D IEF), and protein 8 (by 2D-PAGE). From each of these gel separation techniques, the protein was excised and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS.

All apparent dissociation constants KD* for cytokinins were within the nM range, which is reasonable for a high affinity interaction, and were largely close to KD* values of Arabidopsis receptors for cytokinin ligands (Yamada et al., 2001; Romanov et al., 2005, 2006).|#main_body|GO:1902670|carbon dioxide binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|ZmHK1(541634)|#gene_synonym

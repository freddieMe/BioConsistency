22693572_14|22693572|19094|#section_info|211:601|When exposed to high concentrations of sulfite (5 and 10 mM Na2SO3), leaf discs of OE plants displayed less damage than wild-type plants (Fig. 3A). Sulfite and sulfate content determination revealed that smaller increases in the total sulfite and greater increases in sulfate were observed in both OE lines compared to wild-type plants regardless of 5 or 10 mM sulfite exposure (Fig. 3B,C).|#main_body|GO:1903935|response to sodium arsenite|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|SO(100284296)|#gene_synonym

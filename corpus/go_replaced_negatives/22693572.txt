Sulfite and sulfate content determination revealed that smaller increases in the total sulfite and greater increases in sulfate were observed in both OE lines compared to wild-type plants regardless of 5 or 10 mM sulfite exposure (Fig. 3B,C).|#main_body|GO:0010038|response to metal ion|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|SO(100284296)|#gene_synonym

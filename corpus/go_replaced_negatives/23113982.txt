23113982_17|23113982|13810|#section_info|0:0|To further confirm the mechanism by which p1 controls Zmf3'h1 expression, we found that the Zmf3'h1 promoter contains the cis-regulatory elements CCTACC (-614 ~ -553) and CCAACC (-83 ~ -78), that resemble P1 DNA-binding sites [12]. To test this possibility, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using as probes two DNA fragments spanning regions containing the putative P1 binding sites from -649 to -553 and from -128 to -41 (Figure 4). Our results show that P1 binds both the sites, which is in agreement to consensus sequences CCT/AACC derived from SELEX [12].|#main_body|GO:0000985|bacterial-type RNA polymerase core promoter sequence-specific DNA binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|p1(542272)|#gene_synonym

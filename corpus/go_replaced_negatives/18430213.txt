In case of ZmTSA GFP fluorescence coincided with the chlorophyll autofluorescence of the chloroplasts (Figure 2A-C), demonstrating plastidic localization of ZmTSA. In contrast, ZmTSAlike-GFP was localized in the cytosol (Figure 2D-F).|#main_body|GO:0062116|phenyloplast|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|TSA(100170238)|#gene_synonym

ZmTSA and ZmTSB1 formed a complex of approximately 160 kD (Figure 3A) that according to SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown) contained both proteins in a 1:1 stoichiometry.|#main_body|GO:0062177|radial spoke assembly|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|TSA(100170238)|#gene_synonym
18430213_21|18430213|26745|#section_info|0:376|Four peptides characteristic for ZmTSA were present as major peptide signals in this tryptic digest of the 160 kD fraction containing active TS (Table 2, Figure 5). The probability for a specific random dodeca-peptide, such as e.g. identified GTTFEDVISMVK is in the order of approximately 10-15. Therefore, ZmTSA was conclusively identified as component of a maize TS complex.|#main_body|GO:1904887|Wnt signalosome assembly|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|TSA(100170238)|#gene_synonym

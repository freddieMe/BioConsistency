Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous DSP18 was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with the mitochondrial protein marker SMAC, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum protein marker calreticulin was removed during histodenz gradient purification (Fig. 3E).|#main_body|GO:1990843|subsarcolemmal mitochondrion|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|dusp18(305477)|#gene_synonym

Here, this transporter in maize (ZmYS1) and barley (HvYS1) was further characterized and compared in terms of expression pattern, diurnal change, and tissue-type specificity of localization.|#main_body|GO:0015090|low-affinity ferric iron ion transmembrane transporter activity|#go_definition|NONE|GOA|ZmYS1(541800)|#gene_synonym

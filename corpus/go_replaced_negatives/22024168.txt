22024168_78|22024168|19795|#section_info|588:942|To assess whether the Canoe-Ran interaction is necessary for Mud recruitment to Pins crescents, we performed rescue assays with full-length Canoe and RA domain deletion constructs. The full-length Canoe construct rescued endogenous Mud recruitment to Pins crescents, whereas deletion of both RA domains failed to recruit endogenous Mud (Fig. 5, D and E).|#main_body|GO:1903827|regulation of cellular protein localization|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|Canoe(40620)|#gene_synonym

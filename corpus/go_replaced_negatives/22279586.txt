Sequence analysis indicated that the fad2 allele harbored a site mutation in the second exon, 310 bp downstream of ATG (Fig. 3A), leading to an amino acid mutation (A104T) adjacent to the first highly conserved His-box (105-110: HECGHH), which and the other two His-boxes coordinate the iron atoms at the active site center (Fig. 3B). Fatty acid composition analyses revealed that the levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1) increased significantly in fad2, whereas the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids  whereas the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2 and 18:3) decreased significantly, when compared with those in the wild-type plants. |#main_body|GO:0097251|leukotriene B4 biosynthetic process|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|FAD2(820387)|#gene_synonym

However, germination of fad2 seeds was significantly impaired on MS medium supplemented with 100 or 125 mM NaCl, whereas germination of wild-type seeds was less strongly affected (Fig. 4C-4F). After three days on high salt MS medium (100 mM NaCl), only ~38% of the fad2 seeds, but more than 80% of the wild-type seeds germinated (Fig. 4D). When sown on MS medium supplemented with 125 mM NaCl, only ~12% of the fad2 seeds, but ~73% of the wild-type seeds germinated after 3 days (Fig. 4E). |#main_body|GO:0010187|negative regulation of seed germination|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|FAD2(820387)|#gene_synonym
22279586_24|22279586|11072|#section_info|796:2093|To further test the effect of salt on growth, we compared the root growth of fad2 and wild-type seedlings grown under high salt or osmotic stress condition. Under normal growth condition, root growth of fad2 is slightly impaired. Therefore relative root growth is examined. Root growth of Col-0, fad2, and fad2/FAD2 on medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl or mannitol relative to that on medium without NaCl or mannitol was examined. When grown under high salt or mannitol condition, root growth retardation of fad2 was greater than that of Col-0 and fad2/FAD2 at all concentrations of NaCl and mannitol tested (Fig. 5A-5C). Furthermore, in order to eliminate the inhibition of NaCl on germination, we also tested the root growth of Col-0, fad2, and fad2/FAD2 after germination. Four-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS medium plates supplemented with or without NaCl, and vertically cultured for six days. The root elongation of fad2 was also less than that of Col-0 and fad2/FAD2 (Fig. 5D). The greater root growth inhibition of fad2 indicated that under the imposed salt or mannitol stress conditions, fad2 is more sensitive to the stress treatment. The sensitivity of fad2 salt or osmotic stress was recovered by expression of FAD2 in fad2 mutant (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).|#main_body|GO:2000069|regulation of post-embryonic root development|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|FAD2(820387)|#gene_synonym

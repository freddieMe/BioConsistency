20501650_9|20501650|36344|#section_info|302:788|In the TRPC6-expressing cells, treatment with H2O2 at 10 mum for 3 min remarkably and significantly increased the expression level of biotinylated TRPC6 protein (~1-fold), which was not observed in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 8, A and B). The biotinylated membrane fractions were not contaminated by non-plasma membrane proteins because the actin, a cytoskeletal protein, was negligible in the biotinylated fractions but was clearly present in the corresponding whole-cell lysates |#main_body|GO:0097524|sperm plasma membrane|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Trpc6(89823)|#gene_synonym
20501650_11|20501650|36344|#section_info|807:1103|The biochemical data were corroborated by a fluorescent confocal microscopy assay. In the cells transfected with EGFP-tagged TRPC6 (at the C terminus), we were able to visualize a real time change in abundance of TRPC6 protein in the region of the plasma membrane in response to H2O2 stimulation.|#main_body|GO:0001533|cornified envelope|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Trpc6(89823)|#gene_synonym

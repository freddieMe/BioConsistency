Brassinolide, and its precursors castasterone and typhasterol, were dramatically elevated in lines overexpressing ASKtheta-Myc compared with wild-type plants.  ASKtheta #10, ASKtheta #27 and bri1-1 contained 3.8, 0.5 and 1.2 ng of brassinolide per gram of fresh weight, respectively, whereas brassinolide was below the detection limit in Col-0 plants. The levels of these BRs positively correlated with the severity of the phenotype, abundance of the ASKtheta-Myc protein and its kinase activity (Figure 1a,b). |#main_body|GO:0071367|cellular response to brassinosteroid stimulus|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|ASKth(828023)|#gene_synonym

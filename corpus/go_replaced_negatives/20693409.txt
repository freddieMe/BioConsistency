These results suggest that BR-activated ZmMPK5 is involved in BR-induced antioxidant defence in leaves of maize plants.|#main_body|GO:0000304|response to singlet oxygen|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|ZmMPK5(541618)|#gene_synonym
20693409_15|20693409|23108|#section_info|355:791|The immunoprecipitation kinase assay showed that pre-treatment with DPI and CAT almost completely blocked the BR-induced ZmMPK5 activation, but pre-treatment with DCMU had very little effect on the ZmMPK5 activation induced by BR treatment in leaves of maize plants (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that it is apoplastic H2O2 but not chloroplastic H2O2 that induces the BR-induced activation of ZmMPK5 in BR-induced antioxidant defence.|#main_body|GO:0070301|cellular response to hydrogen peroxide|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|ZmMPK5(541618)|#gene_synonym

Cyp301a1f02301 larvae fed 20E during development eclosed with a significantly reduced incidence of the severe and mild abdominal phenotype, and significantly increased incidence of the wild type cuticle phenotype when compared with those fed control food (Figure 6).|#main_body|GO:0071390|cellular response to ecdysone|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Cyp301a1(36378)|#gene_synonym

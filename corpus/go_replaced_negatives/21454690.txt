A protein construct incorporating both tandem PTB domains (AS160(1-532)) inhibited fusion very potently, and the highest protein concentration tested inhibited fusion completely (Fig. 1D).|#main_body|GO:1905363|positive regulation of endosomal vesicle fusion|Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of vesicle fusion.|IMP|GOA|AS160(686547)|#gene_synonym

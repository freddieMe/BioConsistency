Again, we observed a robust interaction between TRPV4 and beta-arrestin 1 at the 2-min time point (Fig. 1, C and D). |#main_body|GO:0043221|SMC family protein binding|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym

As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, we detected a constitutive interaction between the AT1aR and TRPV4, and this interaction is not modulated by angiotensin stimulation during the time course examined in this experiment.|#main_body|GO:0043560|insulin receptor substrate binding|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym

20650893_8|20650893|17889|#section_info|1323:1771|In yet another approach to confirm internalization of TRPV4 and to investigate whether internalization of TRPV4 translates into a functional down-regulation, we measured 4-alpha-PDD-induced Ca2+ influx in rVSMCs. 4-alpha-PDD is a potent and specific agonist for TRPV4, which leads to robust Ca2+ influx in cells expressing TRPV4. We treated the cells with either PBS or angiotensin for 1 h and subsequently measured 4-alpha-PDD-induced Ca2+ influx.|#main_body|GO:0099533|positive regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium concentration|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym

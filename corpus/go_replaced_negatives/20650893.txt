20650893_1|20650893|12541|#section_info|664:961|We also carried out a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment where we stimulated rVSMCs with angiotensin, immunoprecipitated beta-arrestins, and detected TRPV4 by Western blot. Again, we observed a robust interaction between TRPV4 and beta-arrestin 1 at the 2-min time point (Fig. 1, C and D). |#main_body|GO:0042802|identical protein binding|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym
20650893_4|20650893|16567|#section_info|531:873|Subsequently, we immunoprecipitated either HA-AT1aR or endogenous TRPV4 and detected the respective partner by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, we detected a constitutive interaction between the AT1aR and TRPV4, and this interaction is not modulated by angiotensin stimulation during the time course examined in this experiment.|#main_body|GO:0097602|cullin family protein binding|#go_definition|IPI|GOA|Trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym

20650893_7|20650893|17889|#section_info|803:1009|As shown in Fig. 2A, TRPV4 was localized at the cell surface in non-stimulated cells, and stimulation by angiotensin led to robust internalization as evident by targeting of TRPV4 to intracellular vesicles.|#main_body|GO:0120002|fusiform vesicle|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym
20650893_8|20650893|17889|#section_info|1323:1771|In yet another approach to confirm internalization of TRPV4 and to investigate whether internalization of TRPV4 translates into a functional down-regulation, we measured 4-alpha-PDD-induced Ca2+ influx in rVSMCs. 4-alpha-PDD is a potent and specific agonist for TRPV4, which leads to robust Ca2+ influx in cells expressing TRPV4. We treated the cells with either PBS or angiotensin for 1 h and subsequently measured 4-alpha-PDD-induced Ca2+ influx.|#main_body|GO:0060402|calcium ion transport into cytosol|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|trpv4(66026)|#gene_synonym

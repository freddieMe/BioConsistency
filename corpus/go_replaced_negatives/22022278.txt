Nuclei of the remaining salivary imaginal cells appear larger than in wild-type larvae, suggesting increased DNA content. These phenotypes indicate that MUS312-SLX1 has a more critical role in proliferation in the early larva than MUS81-MMS4 (Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0070341|fat cell proliferation|#go_definition|IGI|GOA|mus312(38809)|#gene_synonym

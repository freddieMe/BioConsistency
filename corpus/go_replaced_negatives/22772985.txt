Further examination by qPCR verified the downregulation of RDR2 and DCL3 in ibm1.

The integrated IBM1 in the transgenic plants was expressed (Figure 3d) and was exclusively nuclear-localized in protoplasts (Figure 3a). Also, a functional YFP-IBM1 fusion protein was produced in vivo, as demonstrated by its ability to complement all of the mutant phenotypes of ibm1-3, including its embryonic defect and abnormally sharp rosette leaves (Figure 3b and c).|#main_body|GO:0031492|nucleosomal DNA binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

Using a bisulfite assay, the intragenic regions of RDR2 (+2509 to +2702) and DCL3 (+4204 to +4396) were amplified, cloned and sequenced. The regions in RDR2 and DCL3 selected for bisulfite sequencing had the highest IBM1 occupancy and greatest increase in H3K9me2 in ibm1 (Figure 4).|#main_body|GO:0043046|DNA methylation involved in gamete generation|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

22772985_63|22772985|33943|#section_info|0:958|Using mRNA-Seq, the reads that mapped to exons of SDC were distinctly enriched in ibm1-3 (Supplementary Figure S4a and Supplementary Table S3). In addition, qPCR confirmed the >=20-fold accumulation of SDC mRNA in all three ibm1 alleles (Supplementary Figure S4b). Subsequently, we analyzed DNA methylation in the entire tandem repeats and in the regions upstream and downstream of the SDC repeats by bisulfite sequencing. In WT plants, all of the sequence contexts were densely methylated (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7). Consistent with this, DNA methylation at CHG and CHH sites in the SDC tandem repeats was slightly reduced in the ibm1 alleles, whereas that in the regions flanking the repeats was not obviously changed (Supplementary Figure S4c and Supplementary Table S7). These data show that the defect in IBM1 reduced RDR2 and DCL3 transcription and partially affected the small RNA-mediated DNA methylation of the SDC locus.|#main_body|GO:1900095|regulation of dosage compensation by inactivation of X chromosome|#go_definition|IMP|GOA|IBM1(819952)|#gene_synonym

The truncation increased the cooperativity of myosin S1-induced tropomyosin binding for short tropomyosins (TM5a and TM1b9a), but it was neutral for long isoforms (smTM and TM2).|#main_body|GO:0051015|actin filament binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tpm1(24851)|#gene_synonym

19041430_3|19041430|12843|#section_info|0:0|Removal of three residues from actin C-teminus had a small effect on the binding of each of the TM isoforms used (Fig. 3). The equilibrium binding constants (Kapp) obtained by fitting the experimental points to the Hill equation (Eq. 1) are summarized in Table 1 and show that actin truncation reduced the isoforms' affinity by a factor ranging between 1.2 and 1.5. The cooperativity coefficient (alphaH) of TMs binding to F-actin-3 was slightly greater than that for the binding to F-actin. The only TM isoform which bound to F-actin-3 with lower cooperativity was TM2 (Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0051015|actin filament binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tpm1(24851)|#gene_synonym
19041430_4|19041430|13591|#section_info|0:0|The analysis revealed that in the case of three isoforms (smTM, TM1b9a and TM5a) the affinity to an isolated binding site (Ko) was reduced and binding to a contiguous site (omega) was increased by modification of the actin C-terminus. The TM2 bound to truncated actin with a binding coefficient Ko similar to that of native actin and with the lower cooperativity (Table 1).|#main_body|GO:0003785|actin monomer binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|Tpm1(24851)|#gene_synonym

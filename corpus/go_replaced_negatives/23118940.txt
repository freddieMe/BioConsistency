Besides low Pi (5 microM), we also analyzed its response to low N (50 microM), high salinity (100 mM NaCl) and high sucrose (Suc) (9.4%). Transcript levels for these NF-YA family members increased between 5 and 50-fold, under all conditions tested, with the exception of high salinity, where only NF-YA5 and NF-YA3 transcript levels increased by 2-fold at 4 and 14 days of treatment, respectively (Figure 1). |#main_body|GO:0036278|positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to nitrogen starvation|#go_definition|IEP|GOA|NF-YA2(819738)|#gene_synonym

18332143_3|18332143|9778|#section_info|317:604|Lysine to alanine mutation of the Walker A motif was made in D1 (K251A) and D2 (K524A) both individually and together (K251A,K524A). To also probe potential communication around the hexamer ring, an arginine finger in the SRH motif was mutated to alanine in both D1 and D2 (R359A,R635A).|#main_body|GO:0006370|7-methylguanosine mRNA capping|#go_definition|TAS|GOA|Srh(116643)|#gene_synonym

18332143_11|18332143|22938|#section_info|143:498|The ITC binding profile of ATPgammaS titrated against wild-type p97 showed that ATPgammaS binding was exothermic at lower ATPgammaS concentrations but became endothermic at higher ATPgammaS concentrations (Fig. 4A, top panel). The mid-point of the exothermic portion indicated a stoichiometry of 0.66 +- 0.125 ATPgammaS molecules binding per p97 monomer. |#main_body|GO:0000035|acyl binding|#go_definition|IDA|GOA|vcp(116643)|#gene_synonym

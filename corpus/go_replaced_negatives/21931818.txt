21931818_1|21931818|100|#section_info|0:0|Here, we combine linkage and association analyses to fine map QTL-Pal9, a QTL influencing levels of palmitic acid, an important class of saturated fatty acid. QTL-Pal9 was mapped to a 90-kb region, in which we identified a candidate gene, Zea mays fatb (Zmfatb), which encodes acyl-ACP thioesterase. |#main_body|GO:0016295|myristoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase activity|#go_definition|NONE|GOA|fatb(fat2)|#gene_synonym
